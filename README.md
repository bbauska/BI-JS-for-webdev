<h3 id="ch1-2">1.2 About this Lesson: JS for Web Dev (0:38)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
In this lesson, you will be introduced to the world of JavaScript, a high level 
programming language that is widely used for web development. 

You will learn about the basics of JavaScript programming, including the syntax, data, 
types and variables. You will also set up your development environment to get started 
with writing  your own JavaScript code. By the end of this lesson, you will have a solid 
understanding of the basics of JavaScript programming.</p>
<pAnd you will be able to create 
simple JavaScript programs. You will also be ready to move on to more advanced topics 
like JavaScript development. Whether you are a complete beginner or have some programming 
experience, this lesson will provide you with a solid foundation in JavaScript 
programming. See you in the next lesson.</p>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch1-3">1.3 Introduction to JavaScript (5:33)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
In this lesson we will learn some history and introduction related to JavaScript. 

The very first question that comes to our mind is, what is JavaScript? 

JavaScript is a programming language that is used to add interactive features to 
websites.

It is used alongside HTML and CSS to make websites more dynamic and engaging. In simple 
terms, JavaScript allows you to add functionality to your web page. For example, you can 
use JavaScript to create interactive forms, add animations, and create dynamic effects
when users interact with your web page.

One of the great things about JavaScript is that it runs in the web browser, which means 
that it can be used on almost any device that has a web browser. This makes it a powerful  
tool for creating cross platform applications that can be used on desktop computers, 
laptop computers, tablets, and smartphones.

Why is it called JavaScript? JavaScript was originally created by Brendan Eich at 
Netscape Communications. The language was initially called Mocha, but it was later 
renamed to Live Script. The decision to rename the language to JavaScript was largely a 
marketing decision made by Netscape. At that time, the company was in heated browser war 
with Microsoft and they wanted to capitalize on the popularity of Java by making their 
language sound similar.

Thank god the community sided with Netscape and saw how Microsoft's Interne Explorer 
was in real terms a piece of shit. This helped to create a perception that JavaScript 
was a complementary technology to Java, even though the two languages are quite different.

JavaScript has become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, 
and it is an essential tool for web developers today. In fact, according to some 
estimates, JavaScript is used over 95% of all websites on the Internet.

Where else beyond the browser can JavaScript be executed? JavaScript is a versatile 
programming language that can be used to create both front end and backend applications. 
It is primarily known for its use in web development, where it is used to add 
interactivity and dynamic effects to web page. 

However, JavaScript can also be used to build serverside applications that run on a web 
server, as well as desktop and mobile applications, and even on IoT devices. This 
versatility is one of the greatest trends of JavaScript as it allows developers to use a 
single programming language to build applications across a wide range of platforms and 
devices. This not only makes development more efficient, but also enables developers to 
create interactive and responsive user interfaces that can respond to user input in real 
time.

Web browsers use different JavaScript engines to interpret and execute JavaScript code. 
For example, V8 is used by Chrome, SpiderMonkey by Firefox, and Chakra by Internet 
Explorer. Each engine has its own unique features and performance characteristics.

What are the tasks that JavaScript can perform? Let&apos;s look at some. 

It can manipulate HTML and CSS. JavaScript can change the style and content of elements 
on a web page. For example, by hiding or showing an element, or changing its color, 
or size, or maybe animating it. Handling user events, JavaScript can
respond to user interactions with the page, such as clicking a button,
submitting a form, or scrolling, and trigger corresponding actions such
as, displaying a message or updating the page content. 

Validate forms, JavaScript can check the user input in a web form. 
For example, to ensure that a required field is not left blank, that a
phone number is valid, or that a password means a certain criteria. 

Add interactivity, JavaScript can add interactive elements to a web page
such as drop down menus, image sliders, or pop up windows to enhance the
user experience and engage users with the content. 

Make HTTP requests, JavaScript can fetch data from a server or send data
to a server using HTTP request. For example, to update the page content
dynamically or submit a form without reloading the page. 

Last but not the least, it can store and manipulate data. JavaScript can store data in 
variables, arrays, and objects, for example, to remember user preferences or to keep 
track of game scores and manipulate the data using built-in functions such as sorting
or filtering.

<p>Let&apos;s summarize this, JavaScript is a high level dynamic programming
language that is used for creating interactive web pages and web
applications.  I would call it a 5<sup>th</sup> generation language feeding off
its' prior 4 levels. 1st is machine language, 2nd "C", 3rd Macro which executes more
or less languages, 4<sup>th</sup> library routine to execute server commands for expected
input and finally, 5<sup>th</sup>, JavaScript.</p>

Originally called Mocha and later renamed to
LiveScript, it was eventually rebranded as JavaScript for marketing
purposes. While it is primarily associated with web development,
JavaScript can also be used on servers and other devices that have a
JavaScript engine. With its versatility and popularity, JavaScript has
become a fundamental language for modern web development.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch1-4">1.4 Setting Up Your Development Environment (2:46)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
In this lesson, we will set up our development environment for JavaScript. So let&apos;s 
get started. To set up your development environment, you need a code editor, a web browser, 
and a JavaScript engine. A code editor enables us to write and organize our code with
features such as syntax, highlight, autocompletion, and code formatting. 

It also provides us with debugging tools to identify and fix errors in
our code. A web browser is necessary for testing our JavaScript code in
a real world environment. It allows us to see how our code interacts with
HTML and CSS on a web page and to test features such as user
interactions and HTTP request. 

A JavaScript engine enables us to run JavaScript code outside of a web
browser, which is useful for building serverside, applications, command
line tools, and other types of applications that do not rely on a web
browser. 

You can follow these basic steps for your development environment. So
the first step is you can install a code editor. You can choose from
variety of free and paid code editors such as Visual Studio Code,
Sublime Text, Atom, or Notepad++. These editors provide features such as syntax
highlighting, autocompletion, and debugging tools that make writing and
debugging JavaScript code easier. You can go to Google and let&apos;s
say if you want to install Visual Studio code, you can just type in the
Google and you can just install it for your OS.

Second is to install a web browser.  You can choose from popular web
browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft
Edge. These browsers have built in developer tools that enable you to
inspect and debug your JavaScript code in real time. 

Last but not the least, you have to install a JavaScript engine. So most
modern web browsers come with their own JavaScript engine. But you can
also install standalone engines such as Node, JS or Rhino. These engines
allow you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, for
example, to build server side applications or command line tools. 

Once you have these tools set up, you can start writing and running
JavaScript code in your code editor and test it on your web browser or
JavaScript engine. So this is all for this lesson. In the next lesson, we
will write our very first JavaScript program.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch1-5">1.5 Writing Your First JavaScript Program (4:39)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>In the previous lesson, you have set up your development environment. Now in 
this lesson, you will write your first JavaScript program. 
Let&apos;s get started. Let&apos;s look at some basic steps to write the first
JavaScript program.</p>

<p>The first step is to open up a code editor. You can choose a code editor
of your choice, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, Notepad++ and
you have to create a new file with the extension.js.</p>

<p>The second step is to write the code. In your new file, you can write
your first JavaScript program, for example, you can write a simple Hello
World program.</p>

<p>The third step is to save the file. You have to save your file with a
meaningful name and the ".js" extension, for example, hello.js.</p>

<p>The last step is to run the program. You can open up a terminal or command prompt and 
navigate to the directory where your program file is saved. There you can type node 
hello.js to run your program. You should see the output printed in the console. 
Let&apos;s actually follow these steps and let&apos;s try our first JavaScript program. I 
will go to my desktop and I will create a new folder and let&apos;s rename it as 
JavaScript.</p>

<p>Now, we can open up our Visual Studio Code. You can use any other code editor if you 
want and then I'll open this JavaScript folder. Now this JavaScript folder is empty. We 
have to create a file, let's call it hello.js. This is for JavaScript extension. Let's 
write our first program. Here you can simply say console.log and let's say Hello World. 
What it does is it prints "Hello World" in the console. It is as easy as that. This is 
the first JavaScript code.</p>

<p>How to run it? There are couple of ways. The first way is to use node js. You can go here 
to the VS Code, you can open up your terminal, and ensure that you are in the directory. 
You can see that here, the directory is this JavaScript folder and then I can say node 
hello.js. As soon as I press enter, you will see the output on the console. That is 
Hello World. This is one way.</p>

<p>Another way is that you can directly go to the Google and you can right-click on Inspect. 
It gives you a Chrome Developer Tools and here what you can do is you can paste this or 
you can write the code. Let's say console.log Hello World. As soon as I press on Enter, 
it runs the code and the output is printed here.</p>

<p>The third way is to use an html file. What we can do is we can create a new index.html 
file and you have to use a boilerplate here. You can use this exclamatory mark and this 
is a shortcut where you can create a basic boilerplate code. What we could do here is we 
have hello.js file. Either you can link this file into your index.html using a script tag 
or you can directly write JavaScript in your script tag. Let's say console.log Hello World. 
How to check it in the browser, you can directly click on index.html and copy the path. 
Once you copy the path, you can go to the browser and you can paste it here. This is a 
blank screen because there is no HTML tag at this point. But as soon as you click on 
Inspect, you will see in the console the Hello World is printed. This is a third way in 
which you can execute your JavaScript code.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you have written and executed your first JavaScript program. This is a 
simple example, but it demonstrates the basic structure and syntax of a JavaScript 
program.</p>

have hello.js file. Either you can link this file into your index.html using a script tag 
or you can directly write JavaScript in your script tag. Let's say console.log Hello World. 

How to check it in the browser, you can directly click on index.html and copy the path. 
Once you copy the path, you can go to the browser and you can paste it here. This is a 
blank screen because there is no HTML tag at this point. But as soon as you click on 
Inspect, you will see in the console the Hello World is printed. This is a third way in 
which you can execute your JavaScript code.

Congratulations, you have written and executed your first JavaScript program. This is a 
simple example, but it demonstrates the basic structure and syntax of a JavaScript 
program. This is all for this lesson. See you in the next lesson. Thank you.

<h3 id="ch1-7">1.7 Variable, Data Types & Operators (7:12)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi there. In this lesson we will learn variables in JavaScript, so
let&apos;s get started. 
Let&apos;s say that you have a box of crayons and you want to organize them
by color. 

You could use different compartments in the box to store each color separately. Each 
compartment would be like a variable and the crayons would be the data stored in 
those variables. 

For example, you could have a compartment for red crayons, a compartment for blue crayons, 
and so on. The number of crayons in each compartment could vary depending on how many 
crayons you have of each color.

In JavaScript, variables work in a similar way. You can think of variable as a container 
that holds a piece of data like a crayon. The variable has a name that you can choose, 
just like the compartment in the crayon box has a label indicating the color of crayons 
it holds. 

You can then use these variables to perform calculations or manipulate the data stored 
in them. Just like you can move crayons from one compartment to another, you can change 
the data stored in a variable as needed. 

Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with some information. Let&apos;s 
see some examples. 

The first is a social media app. In this case, the information might include the 
user&apos;s name, age, and number of followers. 

The second is a music app. In this case, the information might include the user&apos;s 
favorite songs, playlist, and artist.

Variables are used to store this information. To create a variable in JavaScript,  you 
can use let, var, and const keyword.

Let&apos;s understand when to prefer what through some examples. Let&apos;s move to the 
VSCode. Here I have index.html ready with us. We can just create a new file and let&apos;s 
call it as variables.js. You can use var, let, and const, but when to use what lets see 
that. 

Before that, let&apos;s use let keyword and let&apos;s say let name to be John. This is 
how you create a variable. Here you have two process. First is that you are saying let 
name. That means you are declaring a variable.

Then you are assigning the value, that is John in this case, like this. This is variable 
declaration. This is variable initialization. You can in fact do the initialization and 
declaration in the same line like this, you will use in this fashion. 

<span>Let</span> is the preferred way to declare a variable that can be reassigned
later in the code. It is <span>blocked scope</span>, which means that it can only exist 
within the block of code where it was defined. For example, let&apos;s create a variable 
by the name of count and we can give it a value of 0. 

Then you can say count to be 1 and then we can say console.log(count). Now we can run this. 
Let&apos;s clear up the terminal and here we can say, let&apos;s save and let&apos;s
say node variables.js and you can see 1 is printed here. Next we can look at const. 

<span>Const</span> is the preferred way to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned. 
It is also blocked scope. For example, let&apos;s say if you want to use some constants, 
like let&apos;s say Pi. We can say const PI and normally the value of Pi is approximately 
equal to 3.14, and then we can say console.log(PI).

If I click on &quot;Save&quot;, if I run this code, you will see that we get the value. 
But now if someone tries to do this, let&apos;s say four or something, in that case, it 
will give an error, as you can see here, that you cannot assign it to a constant variable. 

The third one that is left is <span>var</span> keyword. Var is older keyword for declaring 
variables in JavaScript. While it can still be used in modern JavaScript, it is generally
considered outdated because it is not blocked scope. 

This means that variables declared with var are available throughout the entire function or 
global scope, which can make it harder to reason about your code and avoid bugs. 

Now all these terms, <span>functions</span> and <span>global scope</span> you will be looking 
at in further lessons in detail. For now, let&apos;s also see how we can create a variable 
using var.

We can say var count = 0 and we can use our if condition here. Again, we will see if 
conditions in detail in the conditional spot. I can say if true, let&apos;s say var 
count to be 1 and then we can say console.log(count). 
In the down, if you will say console.log(count) as well. 
Let&apos;s clear up the terminal and let&apos;s see the output. 

Here you can see that in both the cases, it is 1, that means it is <span>not blocked 
scope</span>. It has shadowed the previous count at this point. Earlier it was 0, even 
though it isn&apos;t a block, that is these curly brackets. 

It has overridden the previous count, and now you can see that in both
the console&apos;s, it is printing 1 and 1 each time. 
Let&apos;s summarize this. Overall variables are a way to store and manage data in your code. 

They allow you to refer to a data by name, which makes your code more
organized and easier to read. To create a variable in JavaScript, you can use 
<span>let</span>, <span>var</span>-, and <span>const</span> keyword. 

<span>Let</span> and <span>const</span> are the preferred keywords for declaring 
variables in modern JavaScript because they are <span>blocked scope</span>, and 
offer better control over variable assignment. 

While <span>var</span> can still be used, it is generally considered outdated and should 
be avoided in new code wherever possible. In the next lesson, we will see data types in 
JavaScript. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch1-8">1.8 Data Types in JavaScript (8:58)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
In the previous lesson we learned variables in JavaScript. Now in this lesson we will 
learn data types in JavaScript. So let&apos;s get started. 

In JavaScript, a data type represents the type of data that can be
stored and manipulated in a program. Let&apos;s look at some common data
types in JavaScript. 

The first one is <span>numbers</span>, a data type that represents both <span>integer</span> 
and <span>floating point</span> numbers. In JavaScript, numbers are represented with the 
number keyword.

Let&apos;s see all these data types side by side with an example. So let&apos;s
move to VS Code. And here I have a file, datatypes.js, ready with me. If
you want to create data with a number type, you can say <span>let</span>, and 
we can just say x. X is a variable name, and we can say 5, this is a number. So 
this creates a variable x of type number with value of 5. 

Next one is <span>BigInt</span>. So for most purposes, we have a range that is 
+(2&Hat;53 - 1) and -(2&Hat;53 - 1) and this range is quite enough. But 
sometimes we need the entire range of really big integers. For example for cryptography 
of microsecond precision timestamps. Now BigInt was recently added to the language to 
represent integers of arbitrary length. A BigInt value is created by appending end 
to the end of an integer. The n means that it&apos;s a big end. Let&apos;s see how 
we can create one. 

So here I can say const and let&apos;s say bigInt, and here we can give
it a very lengthy number. Let&apos;s just give any number and let&apos;s just
say n. Now, if you want to check the type of any variable in
JavaScript, you can say console.log, and we can say typeof bigInt. So if
I click on Save, let&apos;s run this program that is node datatype.js, and
you can see it gives the type as bigInt in the console. BigInt rhombus
are rarely needed. But still if you want, you can use them like this. 

Next data type is <span>String</span>. A data type that represents a sequence of 
characters is a String. In JavaScript, Strings are represented using a String keyword. 
Let&apos;s see an example. If you wanted to create a String, 
you can say let and we can say name, and the name we want to give 
is a string that is a sequence of characters. Let&apos;s give it John. This
creates a variable name of type string with a value of John. Again, if you want
to check the type, you can use this type of operator here, but this is
how you represent a string.

The next one is <span>Boolean</span>, a data type that represents a logical value. It
could be either true or false. In JavaScript, Booleans are represented
using a Boolean keyword. Let&apos;s see an example. 
To create a variable that holds Boolean value, you can say let and we
can give any variable name like is True or something. And we can just
give it a value of true. So this creates a variable isTrue of type
Boolean with a value of true. 

Next is <span>Null</span>. It is a data type that
represents the intestinal absence of any object value. It is represented
using a <span>null keyword</span>. It is a separate data type, and if you want to
create or give a value to a variable, you can just say let and you
can create any variable, let&apos;s say x.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch1-9">1.9 Using Arithmetic and Comparison Operators (8:38)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
In the previous lesson we learned data types in JavaScript. 
Now in this lesson we will learn about arithmetic and comparison
operators in JavaScript. Let&apos;s talk about <span>arithmetic operators</span> 
first. <span>Arithmetic operators</span> in JavaScript are used to perform mathematical
calculations on numerical values. 

As you can see, one of the arithmetic operator is <span>addition</span>.
Then we have <span>subtraction</span>, <span>multiplication</span>, <span>division</span>, 
<span>modulus</span> and <span>exponentiation</span>.

These are some symbols that you can use for these operators.
Let&apos;s go to the VS code and understand them by examples.
I&apos;m in my VS code and let&apos;s create two variables first. 
We can say let x and let&apos;s give it a number 10. 
And we can say, let y and let&apos;s give it a value of 5. 

We want to perform arithmetic operations, so let&apos;s talk about
addition. We can say let sum and addition would be x+ y. 
This is the addition operator.
Then I can just say console.log(sum). 
The result that is stored for x +y is in the variable sum. 

And as soon as I click on Save and run this program, let&apos;s say node
operators.js, you can see the output is 15.
Similarly, let&apos;s take the other examples as well. 
If you want to calculate the difference, you can say let difference, and
this would be equal to x- y. 
This is a subtraction operator. 
For multiplication, you can say let product,
And it would be x into y. 

We use this star symbol. 
This will give you the multiplication of x and y. 
Then we have division, so we can say, let&apos;s create a variable called
quotient,
And let&apos;s make it equal to, x divided by y. 
We use this symbol here.
Then we have modulus, so we normally calculate remainders using a
modulus, that is a percentage symbol. 

Let&apos;s create a variable, let&apos;s say remainder, and we can make it
equal to x%y.
Then last we have exponentiation, so for that we have double
multiplication symbols. 

What do I mean is, let&apos;s create a variable, let result. 
And if you want to calculate the exponential value, you can say x two
times this and then y. 
Just like we were doing console.log(sum), let&apos;s get all the values
here. 
We have console.log(sum) then let&apos;s copy and paste and put
difference here, then we can put product here. 
And then let&apos;s put quotient here, and then we can say remainder, and in
the end, we can just say result. 

Let&apos;s click on Save. 
And let me clear up the terminal and I will run this program again.
Let&apos;s say node and we have operators.js. 
You can see we get the output. 
Sum is 15, difference is 5 and product is 50. 

Then quotient is 2, remainder is 0, and the result is 100,000. 
This is how you can actually use arithmetic operators in JavaScript.
Let&apos;s talk about comparison operators. 

Comparison operators in JavaScript are used to compare values, and in
turn they return a Boolean value that is either true or false based on
the comparison result. 

The following are the comparison operators in JavaScript we have equal
to, we have not equal to, then we have strict equal to, then we have
strict not equal to, then greater than, greater than equal to, and
similarly for less than and less than equal to. 

Let&apos;s also understand these using examples. 

Remember, the output will always be a Boolean value.
Let&apos;s go here and let&apos;s comment everything out. 
Let&apos;s clear up the terminal as well. 
And let&apos;s start with comparison operators.
Let&apos;s take two values. 

Let&apos;s say let a to be 10 again and let&apos;s take b to be 5.
Now what we have to do is we have to compare. 
Let&apos;s use an equal to operator first. 
We can say console.log(a)== b. 
And what should be the output here? 
Say if I run this program, you will see we get the output as false, 
because 10 is not equal to 5. 

Then we can say not equal to. 
We can just copy this, the only thing we have to change is the symbol
that is not equal to.
And if I run this program now, you will see that we get the value false
and the second one we get the value as true. 
And of course, 10 is not equal to 5.

Similarly, we can check for strict equal. 
Strict also checks the data type for it, and then we have strict not
equal as well. 
The only thing in both the cases is that you have to add one equal to
sign extra. 
This is strict equal to and this is strict not equal to. 

Again, the output would be same. 
If I run this program, you will see false true and false true.
Then let&apos;s look at the other remaining operators as well. 
We have greater than, so we can say console.log, this would be a
greater than b, and then we have greater than or equal to. 

It will be like this.
Let&apos;s see the output, let me clear up the terminal. 
And if I run this program you will see we get the output as true and 
true in both the cases. 

A is yes, greater than b and it also satisfies this condition as
well. 
Similarly, we have less than operators. 
Rather than doing this, we can use the opposite bracket. 
And now we have less than and less than equal to. 

If I try to run this program, you will see the last two values are
false and false. 
Let&apos;s summarize this, arithmetic operators in JavaScript are used
for mathematical calculations such as addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, etc. 

Comparison operators on the other hand, are used to compare values
and return a Boolean value based on the comparison result, such as equal
to, not, equal to, greater than, less than, and so on. 

These operators are fundamental in JavaScript programming and understand
standing how to use them is very essential for the beginners. 
In the next lesson, we will understand arrays in JavaScript. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch1-10">1.10 Arrays in JavaScript (5:41)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi there. In the previous lesson, we learned arithmetic and comparison
operators in JavaScript. 
Now in this lesson we will learn arrays in JavaScript so let&apos;s get
started. 

In programming an array is a collection of values that are stored under
a single variable name. 
Arrays can hold any type of value, including numbers, strings, and even
other areas. 
Each value in an array is accessed through its index, which starts at
zero for the first value in the array. 
Let&apos;s understand by an example. 
Let&apos;s say that we have array of numbers, and it normally starts with
square brackets. 

Let&apos;s say we have numbers as 10,20,30,40 and 50. 
In this example, we have an array and you can call 
it as my array or whatever the variable name you want to give. 
It contains five values, 10,20,30,40 and 50. 

Each value is stored in a separate slot in the array, which is
identified by its index number and how we can identify it? 
The first value in the array 10 is stored in slot zero, and that is
called list index. 

The second value 20 is stored in slot one, then two, then three, then
four and then so on. 
Let&apos;s also see the array example in VS Code. 
You can think of array in JavaScript like a drawer with multiple
compartments. 
Each compartment has a label and you can put things in each
compartment, for example let&apos;s say that you have a drawer labeled
fruits.

What we want here is inside the drawer, you have compartments labeled as
apples, oranges, and bananas. 
You can put one or more fruits in each compartment. 
Similarly, in JavaScript, you can create an array 
called fruits and store multiple values in it. 
The array can contain different types of values, like strings, numbers,
or even other areas. 

You can access the values in the array by using an index number, just
like opening a specific compartment in the draw. 
Let&apos;s create an array of fruits. 
We can say let&apos;s put some fruits here. 
This is an array and we can put apples, oranges and let&apos;s also put
bananas. 

This is an array of strings, all these values are strings. 
How to access the first element in the array? 
We can just say console.log. 
How to access this, you can see fruits and you can use this square
bracket notation and you could pass the index. 

Fruits at index zero will give you the output as apples. Let&apos;s test it
out. 
If I click on Save and if I run this program, that is node arrays, you
will see that we get the values as outputs. 

If you say fruits at index one, you will get oranges. 
There are also some built-in methods 
in JavaScript for arrays, for example let&apos;s say if you want to add a
new fruit to this array. 

How we can do it, we can say fruits.push. 
Let&apos;s say we want to add grapes. 
Now if I just print out the original array, so let&apos;s say
console.log, and let&apos;s consume fruits. 

Let&apos;s run the program and you will see here that the grapes has been
pushed at the end of the array. 
Similarly, we have a pop method as well. 
What we can do is we can say fruits.pop.

If I do console.log fruits again and let&apos;s run this program, you will
see we get back the original array. 
Why? Because the last value that is grapes is popped out from the end of
the array. 
There are more built-in methods, but these are some, or you can say the
most used methods in array. 

Let&apos;s summarize this. 
Array is a collection of values that are stored under a single variable
name. 
Arrays can hold any type of value including numbers, strings, and even
other arrays. 

You can also see the syntax here. 
Here we have array of numbers, array of strings and the last one is
mixed array, that is array of mixed data types. 
You can create an array in JavaScript using square brackets and
separating the values with comma. 

You can access the values in an array using the index number of the
value we want to retrieve. 
For example fruits at index one. 

You can modify the values in an array by assigning a new value to a
specific index. 
Arrays also have built-in methods that you can use to manipulate the
data in the array. 

Just push to add a value to the end of the array and pop to remove the
last value from the array. 
Understanding arrays is a very important concept in programming as
they allow you to store and access multiple values under a single
variable name. 

In the next lesson, we will understand about strings and string
manipulation in JavaScript. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch1-11">1.11 Working with Strings (6:17)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->

Hi there. In the previous lesson, we learned about arrays. 
Now in this lesson we will learn strings in JavaScript. Let&apos;s get
started. 
In JavaScript, the textual data is stored as strings. 
There is no separate type for a single character. 
A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, either single
quotes, double quotes, or backticks. 
Let&apos;s look at a few examples of strings in JavaScript. 

Let&apos;s go to the VS Code, and here I have a file letter, strings.js. 
Let&apos;s create strings with all the quotes. 
Let&apos;s say let str1, this is a variable and we can use double quotes so
we can say, hello, world.
Now, this is a string. 
If you want, you can check using type of operator that we will do. 

Second, we can say let str2, and we can just type anything. 
This time, you will note that I&apos;m using a single quote. 
Let&apos;s say this is our string. 
Lastly, we can use backticks as well. 
We can say let str3, this is the third variable, and let&apos;s say 123, and
this is now a string. 

Of course, if you can consolidate, you will get the outputs on the
console, but lets just do the type of them. 
Let&apos;s say console.log, typeof str1 then comma, and say typeof str2, and
then we can say typeof str3. 
Let&apos;s open up the terminal and let&apos;s run this program. 
I&apos;ll say node and string.js. 
You will see that we get the output as a string, string, and string. 
All these are type of steps. 
Single and double quotes are essentially the same. 
Tactics, however, allow us to embed any expression into the string. 
That means they have some extended functionality. 
Let&apos;s see that as well. 
Here I would say console.log, and here we can just use backticks. 
We can say 1 plus 2 to be equal 2, and you can embed an expression using
a dollar and curly bracket sign. 

We can say 1 plus 2 and it will evaluate the expression and then convert
it into the string. 
Now if I tried to run this program again, you will see that we get 1
plus 2 and we get the evaluated expression that is 3 in this case.

You can find the length of a string using the dot length property. 
Let&apos;s see how length property works. 
Here we have a string and let&apos;s say we are taking a str2. 
I recommend the rest of the code. 
Then I can say console.log, and it gives us str2.length.
Many people get confused and they try to access this like this. 

This is not a function, this is not a method, it is a property. 
Property does not have parentheses. 
Now, if I try to run this program, you will see that we have the output
as 16. The length of this is 16.
You can access individual characters in a string using the square
bracket notation. 
Just like an edit to get a character, add some position, let&apos;s say
pause. 

You can use square brackets or use some built-in methods as well. 
Let&apos;s say if we want to get or access the first letter of the string or
the first character of the string. 
You can say console.log. 
We can see here str and let&apos;s say you want to get at index zero. 

If I click on Save and if I try to run this program, you will see that
we get the value as P. You can access more characters using their
indexes. 
One more important thing to note is that strings are immutable. 
That means strings can be changed in JavaScript, it is impossible to
change a character. 

What I will do is we have absolute position the character as P. Let&apos;s
do what? 

Let&apos;s say str2 at index zero, and let&apos;s give it H, and now let&apos;s run
this program. 

You will see that it is T but if I console this again in the end, let&apos;s
see what do we get as the output. 

If I run it again, you will see that we get, this is a string only and
you can see the character at index 0 has not changed. 

It is still T. That means strings are immutable. 

Let&apos;s summarize this. 

In JavaScript we have strings which are used to store textual data. 

Strings are a sequence of characters and closing quotes, including
single quotes, double quotes, or backticks. 

Backticks are all expressions to be embedded into a string using dollar
and curly brackets. 

The link property of a string returns its length. 

To access the characters at specific position, square brackets or
built-in methods can be used. 

Strings are immutable in JavaScript and cannot be changed. 

It means it is possible not to change a character. 

The length of a string can be found using.length property and individual
characters accessed using the square bracket notation. 

In the next lesson, we will see string manipulation in JavaScript. Thank
you.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch1-12">1.12 String Manipulation (6:34)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi there, in the previous lesson we learned strings. 
Now in this lesson we will learn string manipulation in JavaScript. 
Let&apos;s get started.
String manipulation refers to the process of modifying or manipulating a
string of characters in some way to achieve a desired output. 

A string in a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes such as, Hello
World. 
String manipulation in JavaScript involves manipulating and
transforming strings which are sequence of characters.

Let&apos;s look at some most common techniques for manipulating strings in
JavaScript.
The first one is, concatenation. 
Concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings together to
create a new string. In JavaScript you can concatenate strings using the
plus operator or the concat() method. Let&apos;s look at the examples. 

Let&apos;s go to the VS code, and here I have a file that is
stringManipulation.js. 

Let&apos;s create two strings, let str1, and this would be Hello. And
let&apos;s create another string that would be let str2, and this would be
World. And let&apos;s use these two operators and methods. The plus operator
can be used to concatenate two or more strings. We can say let result
and it would be equal to str1. 

Then we can say +. And then we have to add a space, so let&apos;s add some
empty space. Then again, this + operator and then str2. If I do
console.log(result), we should get the two added strings.  Meanwhile,
let&apos;s also perform the same thing using a concat() method. 

The concat() method can be used to concatenate two or more strings
together. So here we have this result, and let&apos;s say, Let result 2. 

And in this case we will use a concat() method.  We&apos;ll say
str1.concat. 
And we want to add a space, and then we want to add str2. 
And let&apos;s also do console.log(result2). 

Now if I click on Save, let&apos;s open up the terminal and let&apos;s run this
program.
would say node stringManipulation.js and you will see in both the cases
we get the same output. Basically, you can use either a plus operator or
a concat operator for adding the strings.

The second one is substring. A substring is a portion of a string that
you can extract. In JavaScript, you can use either the slice method or
substring method to get a substring from a string. Let&apos;s look at both
the methods.

Here we are in the VS code again, and let me comment these things. 
And let&apos;s look at how to get a substring. 
First let&apos;s use a slice method.
Let&apos;s comment these as well. 

We can create a single string, let&apos;s say str, and let&apos;s give it
Hello World. And here what we want to do is, we can say let result and we want to get
a portion of it. 

We can say str.slice. And here we can pass let&apos;s say 7 and 12 as the indexes.
The slice method extracts a section of a string and it returns a new
string without modifying the original string. 
You can pass one or two arguments. 
Here we are passing two arguments. 

If you pass one argument, the slice method will return all the
characters from that index to the end of the string. 

If you pass two arguments, in this case, the slice method will return
all the characters from the first index up to, but not including the
second index. Here if I do console.log(result), We should get the output as World. 

Let&apos;s run this program, and you will see we get World as well. 
Let&apos;s also look at a substring method. 
Same what we can do is, we can say let result2 and here we can say
str2.substring. 
And here we can pass again, 7 and 12. 
This substring method extracts a section of a string, and again, it
returns a new string without modifying the original string. 

Here also you can pass one or two arguments. 
Here we are passing a two argument. 

This method will return all the characters from the first index up to
but not including the second index. 
Here also, if I do console.log(result2), we should get the same
output.
Let&apos;s run this program, and you will see that we get world and world
in both the cases.

Let&apos;s summarize this, in JavaScript string manipulation is the
process of performing operations on strings such as, concatenating,
extracting, substrings. 

And there are many more like replacing characters and changing the case
of the letters. 

We have seen the most used one, you can of course explore the other ones
as well. 
Concatenation can be achieved using a plus operator or the concat()
method that we have seen. 
Substrings() method can be extracted using the slice() method or the
substring() method. 

You can also explore replace() method to uppercase or lowercase methods
for casing of the letters. 
Then you can also explore trim() method for removing the white space.
Note that, each of these methods returns a new string and does not
modify the original one. 
This is all for this lesson, see you in the next lesson. 
Thank you.

**Understanding variables and data types**

JavaScript is a dynamically typed (also called loosely typed) scripting
language. That is, in JavaScript variables can receive different data
types over time. Datatypes are basically typed data that can be used and
manipulated in a program.

Variables in JavaScript are containers that hold reusable data. It is
the basic unit of storage in a program.

**Using arithmetic and comparison operators**

Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on the
operands. The following operators are known as JavaScript arithmetic
operators. The JavaScript comparison operator compares the two operands.

**Working with strings and string manipulation**

Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text
form. Some of the most-used operations on strings are to check their
length, build and concatenate them using the + and += string operators,
check for the existence or location of substrings with the indexOf()
method, or extract substrings with the substring() method.

<h3 id="ch1-13">1.13 About this Lesson: Control Structures & Functions (0:48)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi there. In this lesson, you will learn about control structures and
functions in JavaScript. 

Control structures allows you to make decisions and repeat code based on
certain conditions. 

You will learn how to use conditional statements like if else and
switch, as well as looping structures like for and while to create more
dynamic and flexible programs. 

Additionally, you will learn about functions in JavaScript, which are a
way to group a set of related statements and execute them whenever you
want. 

You will learn about the syntax of creating functions, the different
types of functions, and how to call them. 

We will also explore scope, which refers to the visibility of
variables and functions in different parts of your code. 

By the end of this lesson, you will have a strong foundation in control
structures and functions, which are fundamental concepts in
JavaScript, and essential to build more complex programs.

<h3 id="ch1-14">1.14 Conditional Statements (if/else, switch) (7:17)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi there. In this lesson, we will learn about conditional statements like if/else, and 
search in JavaScript. Let&apos;s get started. Let&apos;s talk about if/else first. The 
if/else statement allows you to execute different blocks of code based on certain 
conditions. Let&apos;s look at the general syntax. We have if then we have a condition, 
and then we have a block, and then we have else, and then another block that is curly 
brackets. 

If the if condition is true, you can see that in the comment it has written code to be 
executed if the condition is true, otherwise, it will go to the else condition, if the 
condition is false. You can think of a situation where you are deciding whether to go 
outside or stay indoors based on the weather. If the weather is sunny, you will go 
outside, otherwise, you will stay indoors. 

Let&apos;s try to create an example using if/else statements around this. 
Here I&apos;m in my VS code and here I have a basic index.html structure
ready along with index.js file. 
Let&apos;s say const weather this would be a variable that we want to hold
the value as sunny, it is a string, and then we can say if weather = =
to sunny. 

In that case, we can say console.log.
It would be double quotes here. 
We can say, let&apos;s go outside, and then we can say else. 
Let&apos;s print out console.log. 
Let&apos;s stay indoors. 
Now if I click on &quot;Save&quot;, you can see that the weather is sunny here. 

If I can go to the inspect and let&apos;s go to console, let&apos;s see what we
get as the output. 

We&apos;re getting an error here, the unexpected end of input. Add this. 

Here we have to close the else block as well, like this, and now if I
click on &quot;Save&quot; here, you can see that we get, let&apos;s go outside
because in this case, the weather is sunny. 

If you change the weather to, let&apos;s say rainy or something, it will
print, let&apos;s stay indoors. 

In this example, if the weather variable is equal to sunny, the code
inside the first block will execute and it will output let&apos;s go outside
to the console. 

Otherwise, the code inside the else block will execute and output would
be, let&apos;s stay indoors. 
Let&apos;s look at a new type of conditionals, that is switch statements. 
The switch statement is useful when you have multiple conditions to
check against a single variable. 

It provides a concise way to select one of many code blocks to execute. 
Let&apos;s look at the syntax of switch case statements. 
You have a switch and then you have an expression. 
Based on different values or you can say cases, there are different
codes that gets executed. 

You can imagine that you are at a restaurant. 
I&apos;m choosing a dish from a menu based on the number associated with
it. 
Let&apos;s create an example around this. 
Again, I&apos;m in my VS code and let&apos;s comment this out. 

We can say const and we can give our dishNumber variable to be, let&apos;s
say two. 
Now we can say switch on the basis of dishNumber. 
See dishNumber could be anything yet in our case we are taking it as
two. 
It could be any number or even any data type that you want. 

We can say if the case is one, that means if the dishNumber is one, we
can say console or we can just print out, you ordered a burger something
like that. 
Then we have to break out from the switch case statement. 
We will discuss about this in a minute. 
Next word we can do is we can just copy paste this, and we can create a
second case. 

In this particular case, what we can do is we can just say, if the case
is 2, we can say you ordered pizza. 
Similarly, we can create as many cases as we want to. 
Let&apos;s have case 3, and in the third case, it would be a different
order. 

We can say case 3 here, and let&apos;s say you ordered pasta. 
Then we can have our case for where we can just print out or let&apos;s
say the order would be you ordered something else. 
If you don&apos;t want this case 4, in the last, you can have a default case
if, neither of these cases are true. 

That means if dishNumber is not even 1, 2, or 3 so default, it would
be, let&apos;s say console.log, and we can put here a message like
sorry, that dish is not available. 
As easy as that. 
If I click on &quot;Save&quot;, if we go here to the console, you can see that
you ordered pizza is printed because that is the case. 

If I do case 1 here, you will see that it will print you ordered a
burger. This is all switch case statement works. 

In this example, when this number is two, the code inside the switch
case second block will get executed and it will output you ordered pizza
to the console. 

This break statement is important, insert statements. 
It ensures that the code inside the matching case block executes and
prevents it from falling through the subsequent cases. 

For example, if I remove the break statement from here and from here as
well, you will see that since case 1 and case 2, 3 do not have any break
statements, it will run all the cases here after two. 
That means you order pizza, you ordered pasta and the dish is not
available. 
This is not what we want. 
Always include break statements to break out of the switch statement. 
Let&apos;s summarize this. 

Conditional statements in JavaScript, such as if/else and switch, allows
you to execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions. 
If/else statements helps you to make decisions while switch
statements provide a concise way to select code blocks based on
different cases. 

By using these conditional statements, you can control the flow of your
program and execute specific code paths depending on various
conditions. 
In the next lesson, we will learn about looping structures for and
while. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch1-15">1.15 Looping Structures (For, While, Do..While) (6:43)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi there. 
In the previous lesson we learned conditional statements. Now in this
lesson we will learn about looping structures and specifically about for,
while, and do-while loops. 

So let&apos;s get started. 

Loops are programming constructs that allows you to repeat a block of
code multiple times. 

They provide a way to automate repetitive tasks and iterate over a
collection of data. 

Loops are essential in programming because they help in reducing code
duplication, improving efficiency, and making programs more dynamic. 

Let&apos;s look at some **loops**. 
For loop, the for loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code
for a specific number of times. 
It normally consists of three parts, initialization, where you
initialize a variable that will control the loop. 

A condition, that is, the condition that determines whether the loop
should continue executing or stop. 
And the third is, increment and decrement. 
And that means after each iteration of the loop, the variable is
modified according to the increment or decrement specified there. 

Let&apos;s understand this for loop through an example. 
So let&apos;s go here. And into the VS code and we can say for. This is how
we start write a for loop. 
And then we can say let i, so this is the first part that is
initializing. 

The second part is a **condition**. Condition here we can put is i
should be less than or equal to 5. And then we can put the **increment
decrement**, that is the third part. So we can say i++. And then we can
say console.log, just print out i. Let&apos;s see the output first. 

As expected, you can see in the console the output is 12345. In this
example, the loop starts with i set to 1. The **condition** i less than
equal to 5 checks if i is less than or equal to 5. And if true, the code
inside the loop is executed, which simply locks the value of i to the
console. After each iteration, i is incremented by 1 because we are
putting here increment, that is, i++. The loop continues until i become
6, at which point this condition will become false and the loop will
exit. 

Let&apos;s look at the second loop, that is, **while** loop. 

The while loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code while a
condition is true. 
It only has a condition and as long as the condition remains true, the
loop will continue executing. 

Let&apos;s do the same example using while loop.
We can say while the condition is true. 

What is the condition here? Condition i, i is less than equal to
5. But then where is i? So we have to declare it. So we can declare it,
outside, we can say let i to be 1. And then inside it, we can say
console.log (i). But here, there is a problem i has not been
incremented. So we have to do i++ after printing the value. And that&apos;s
it, if I click on save, you can see that we get the same output. 

In this example, we start again with i set to 1. The condition is again
set to i less than equal to 5, and it is checked before each iteration. 
As long as i is less than or equal to 5, the code inside the loop is
executed, which locks the value of i to the console. 

And after each iteration, i is incremented by 1, that is i++. 
The loop again continues until i become 6 at which point the
condition will become false and the loop exists. 

Let&apos;s look at the third type of loop, that is, do-while loop. 
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it checks the
condition after the executing the loop block. 

This means that the code inside the loop will always execute at least
once. 
First, let&apos;s do the same code using do-while loop, and then let&apos;s look
at the difference as well. 

So we can say let i to be 1. 
And then we can say do, then a block of code, and then we can print out
the value of i like this. 
And after that, we can say i++, that means incrementing the value of i. 
And then we can check the condition, let&apos;s say while, this condition is
true. 

While i is less than equal to 5, that&apos;s it.
Now if I click on Save, you will see that we get the same output. 
But then what is the difference between while and do-while loop? 
While they have been created in a different way. 

To understand this, I will make the condition false. 
I will say do run this code while i is greater than 5. 
And you can see that the value of i is 1.
And when we say i is greater than 5, if I click on Save, you will see
that still it prints 1 and then it checks the code. 

And then it checks the condition that i is not greater than 5, it is
false, then it does not go into the next iteration, but it will execute
once even if the condition is false. 
And with the case of while loop, it will definitely not print anything. 

If we say I is greater than 5, you will see that it will not print
anything. 
That is the difference between while and do-while loop. 
Let&apos;s summarize this. 

Looping structures in JavaScript such as for, while, and do-while loops
allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times based on a specific
conditions. 
The for loop is used when you know the number of iterations in advance. 

While the while loop is suitable for indefinite iterations, the do-while
loop ensures that the code block executes at least once. 
These loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks
for controlling the program flow. 

In the next lesson, we will understand about functions and scope. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch1-16">1.16 Functions and Scope (7:50)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi there. In the previous lesson we learned about looping structures such
as for while and do-while loop in JavaScript. Now in this lesson, we will
learn about functions and scope. Let&apos;s get started. Let&apos;s talk about
functions in JavaScript first. Functions are a block of code that
perform a specific task. They allow you to group reusable code and
execute it whenever needed. Functions can accept input values called
parameters, and it can return output values. 

This is the syntax of a function. Let&apos;s break down the different parts
of the syntax. The first is this function keyword. This function keyword
is used to declare a function in JavaScript. It tells the interpreter
that you are defining a new function. 

Then we have function name. This is the name you give to your
function. Always choose a meaningful and descriptive name that reflects
the purpose of the function. The name should follow JavaScript naming
convention, for example, starting with the letter, or white spaces, or
using special characters. 

Then we have something called parameters. Parameters are placeholders
for values that the function expects to receive when it is called. They
are optional and you can have zero or more parameters. Parameters are
separated by commas and are enclosed in parentheses. These parameters
act as local variables within the function. 

Then we have this block of code, that is the function body. The function
body is enclosed within curly braces. It contains the code that defines
the actions or computations the function will perform. This is where you
write the instructions that makes up the functionality of a function. 

Then we have an optional return statement. The return statement is
optional and is used to specify the value that the function
should return back to the caller. If the return statement is present, it
immediately ends the function&apos;s execution and return the specified
value. If no return statement is used, the function will return
undefined by default. 

Let&apos;s look at an example of function that adds two numbers. I&apos;m in my
VS code here. We can say function. Let&apos;s give the function name as
addNumbers. We can pass parameters. They&apos;re optional. You can pass zero
or more parameters, and then we can say return. It is also optional. We
just want to return a+b or where this a+b will come from. To call or
invoke the function, you can use its name followed by parentheses, and
then passing the arguments. That means you can just call them like this
inside the parentheses and we can pass the numbers as 10 and 20, 10
would be a and 20 would be b. 

If I click on Save, we are calling the function. Let&apos;s go to Inspect
and to the console, we do not get any output. This is because this
function is only returning. To print the return value, you have to put
it in console statement. If I click on Save, now you can see that you
get the output as 30. 

Here, the function addNumbers is called with 10 and 20 as the
arguments. The result is stored in the variable and then you can log
into the console. If you want to store this addNumbers, you can store it
in a variable sum as well. We can say const sum to be like this, and
then we can say console.log sum, it gives you the same output as you can
see, 30. 

Let&apos;s talk about scope in JavaScript. Scope refers to the visibility
or accessibility of variables within a specific part of the code. It
determines where variables can be accessed and where they are not
accessible. 

There are two types of scope in JavaScript. We have global and local
scope. Let&apos;s talk about global scope first. Variables declared outside
of any function are considered global and can be accessed from anywhere
in the code. 

Let&apos;s try to understand them with an example. Let&apos;s comment this piece
of code and then we can create a variable, let&apos;s call it as global
variable. This is not inside any function. That is why it is a global
variable. We can just say, store a string here, I am a global variable,
something like that. Now we can say function logGlobal, something like
that.

Here, we can just say console.log, global variable. 

If I click on Save, we need to call this function as well. That is
logGlobal. 

Now it does not accept any arguments, so we are just calling it like
this. 

If I click on Save, you can see that it prints the output that I am a global variable. In this example, this global
variable is defined outside of the function and can be accessed
inside the logGlobal function and almost anywhere in the code. 

Next we have is local scope. 

Variables declared inside a function are considered local and can only
be accessed within that function. 

For example, let&apos;s create a new function here, and let&apos;s name it as
logLocal. 

Inside this, we can create variable, let&apos;s say const localVariable. 
We can just hold a string here. 
Let&apos;s say I am a local variable because it is created inside our
function. 

Then you can say console.log local variable. 

Now if I call this function that is logLocal, let&apos;s see what do we get
as the output. 

You can see that the variable is printed here. 

But if you try to access it outside of the function, it will give an
error that local variable is not defined. 

In this example, what we&apos;re doing is local variable is defined
inside the logLocal function and can only be accessed within this
function. 

If you attempted to access it outside of the function, it will result in
an error that we have seen already. 

Let&apos;s call it like this. 

It&apos;s important to note that variables declared within a block using let
or const also have block scope, meaning that they are accessible only
within that block. 

Let&apos;s summarize this. 

Functions in JavaScript allows you to group reusable code and perform
specific tasks. They can exert parameters and return values. 

Scope, on the other hand, determines the visibility and accessibility
of variables within a specific part of the code. 

Understanding functions and scope is crucial for writing modular,
reusable, and well organized JavaScript code. 

By using functions and understanding scope, you can create more
structured programs and avoid naming conflicts between variables.

<h3>Conditional statements (if/else, switch)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use <span class="consolas">if</span> to specify a block of code to be executed, if 
    a specified condition is true,</li>
  <li>Use <span class="consolas">else</span> to specify a block of code to be executed, 
    if the same condition is false,</li>
  <li>Use <span class="consolas">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if 
    the first condition is false,</li>
  <li>Use <span class="consolas">switch</span> to specify many alternative blocks of code 
    to be executed,</li>
  <li>The <span class="consolas">if Statement</span> - Use the if statement to specify a 
    block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.</li>
</ul>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3>Looping structures (for, while)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<p>The JavaScript <span class="consolas">loops</span> are used to iterate the piece of code 
using <span class="consolas">for, while, do while or for-in loops</span>. It makes the code 
compact. It is mostly used in array.</p>

<p>There are four types of loops in JavaScript;</p>
<ul>
  <li>for loop</li>
  <li>while loop</li>
  <li>do-while loop</li>
  <li>for-in loop</li>
</ul>

<h3>Functions and scope</h3>
<p>Another essential concept in coding is <span class="consolas">functions</span>, 
which allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block,
and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short
command --- rather than having to type out the same code multiple times.

<h2 id="ch2">Module 2: Manipulating the DOM</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch2-1">2.1 About the DOM (0:46)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi there. In this lesson, we will be exploring the Document Object Model
and how to manipulate it with JavaScript. The DOM is a programming
interface for web documents that represents the page so that programs
can change the document structure, style and content. We will learn how
to access and manipulate DOM elements using JavaScript, which can be a
powerful tool in creating dynamic and interactive web pages. We will
also cover modifying styles and attributes with JavaScript that will
allow us to update the appearance and behavior of web pages on the fly. 

By the end of this lesson, you will have a solid understanding of the
DOM and how to use JavaScript to interact with it. Which will provide
you with the necessary skills to create more advanced and interactive
web pages.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch2-2">2.2 Understanding the Document Object Model (DOM) (3:51)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi, there. In this lesson we will learn <span class="consolas">DOM</span> and 
<span class="consolas">HTML</span>. So let&apos;s get started. <span class="consolas">DOM</span> 
stands for <span class="consolas">Document Object Model</span>.

<p>The <span class="consolas">Document Object Model</span> is a programming interface for 
web document. It represents the <span class="consolas">HTML or XML</span> document as a 
tree-like structure where each node in the tree corresponds to a different part of the 
document. The dominance for web developers to interact with the contents of a webpage 
using JavaScript.</p>

<p>It allows them to add, remove, or modify elements dynamically. You can imagine a webpage 
as a tree where each branch represents an element in the webpage, such as a paragraph or 
an image. Each leaf represents a property or attribute of that element, such as a text 
inside the paragraph or the source URL of the image. This is essentially what DOM is.</p>

JavaScript can manipulate the DOM by selecting nodes and changing their
properties or adding and removing nodes altogether. 
For example, you could use JavaScript to change the texts inside a
paragraph tag or add a new paragraph or image to a page, remove an
element from the page entirely, or maybe change the attributes of an
elements such as its size, color, or position. 

<!-- <image> -->
This is how tree structure would look like. 

<p>This <span class="consolas">tree diagram</span> represents the hierarchical structure 
of the <span class="consolas">DOM</span> for a given webpage.</p>

<p>Each <span class="consolas">node</span> in the tree corresponds to an HTML element or 
a piece of text within that element. The nodes are arranged in a <span class="consolas">
parent-child</span> relationship with parent nodes higher up in the tree and child nodes 
branching off from their parent nodes below. For example, document is the parent tree of 
this HTML.</p>

<p><span class="consolas">HTML</span> is a <span class="consolas">child</span> of 
<span class="consolas">document</span>. In this particular diagram, the 
<span class="consolas">root node</span> is the <span class="consolas">document object</span>, 
which represents the entire webpage. The first level of the child nodes 
corresponds to the top-level HTML elements, such as HTML then we have head, then we 
have body as well. Each of these nodes have one or more child nodes depending on the 
structure of the webpage.</p>

Head has further child nodes, body has further child nodes. 
For example, the body node might have child nodes corresponding to a
header section, a main content area, and a footer section. 
Each of these child nodes might have further child nodes, such as 
paragraphs, images, or other HTML&apos;s. 

For example here we have H1 in the body, and this one has a further
child node of x that is welcome to my page. 

This <span class="consolas">tree diagram</span> is useful for visualizing the structure of a webpage
and understanding how different elements are related to one another. 

By traversing the tree and selecting different nodes, developers can use 
JavaScript to modify the contents of the webpage and create dynamic and 
interactive effects. 

Let&apos;s summarize this. 

The Document Object Model is a programming interface for web documents
that represents that HTML or XML document in a tree-like structure of
nodes. 

Each node in the tree corresponds to a different part of the
document, and JavaScript can manipulate the DOM by selecting nodes and
changing their properties or adding and removing nodes altogether. 

The DOM is a powerful tool for web development and it allows developers
to create dynamic interactive webpages.

<h3 id="ch2-3">2.3 Accessing DOM elements with JavaScript (7:21)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
In the previous lesson we learned DOM in JavaScript. Now in this lesson we will see how 
to access DOM using JavaScript.

Accessing DOM elements with JavaScript is a key skill for web development. As we know, 
the Document Object Model is a tree-like structure that represents the HTML elements of 
a web page.

You can use JavaScript to access these elements in various ways. 
To get started you will need to know how to select an element. 
Let&apos;s look at some commonly used DOM selectors in JavaScript. 
First is <span class="consolas">document.getElementById</span>. 
It returns the element with the specific ID. Let&apos;s see how we can use that. 

So let&apos;s go to the VS code and here I have index.html file. 
I can delete this one and let&apos;s create a very basic boilerplate using
this shortcut and you can see we have a title document let&apos;s make it
DOM. 
And in the body we can say h1 of DOM Selectors. 

If I click on save you can see that we have the output on the web page. 
We are talking about <span class="consolas">document.getElementById</span>. 
Here we can have a <span class="consolas">div</span> and let&apos;s say hello world. 
And what we can do is we can create one more <span class="consolas">div</span> and we 
can just say "hi there". 

Now the first div we will just give it an ID of let&apos;s hello. 
We want to access this div out of all these elements we want to access the first div of ID hello. 
Here I will have a script tag and I will say document or we can 
say <span class="consolas">console.log(document.getElementById)</span> and we can pass the ID name
here. 

The ID is hello we have to pass it in quotes. And now if I click on save let&apos;s go to 
inspect, let&apos;s go to console and you can see that we have got this div. It&apos;s cool, 
right? We have got this on the basis of ID. 
The next one is <span class="consolas">document.getElementsByClassName</span>. 

The little difference you will see that it is get elements earlier one
was get element. 
We can only get one element out of it but here we can get multiple
elements by class name. 
It returns a collection of all the elements with the specified class
name. 

For example, if I create an unordered list and inside that I have a li (list item)
of class, let&apos;s say green. And we can say item one and we can create one more li 
or let&apos;s say four li's out of which only two has the class of green. 
We can remove these options here. 

If I click on save and if I rather than doing this, what I can do is I
can say let items, I can also put them in a variable. 

I can say <span class="consolas">document.getElementsByClassName</span> and we can pass 
the class name as "green" and then we can say console.log items. 
If I click on save if I go here, if I refresh you will see that we get
an HTML collection. 
It is an array like structure and we get two "li" items that has the class
of "greenColor". Let&apos;s go to the next one. Next one is
<span class="consolas">document.getElementsByTagName</span>.

Here also we can get multiple collections or you can say it returns a
collection of all the elements with the specified tag name. We have
multiple items li items here. What we can do is let&apos;s just copy paste
this instead of document.getElementsByClassName we can say get elements
by tag name. 

Here the tag name is li. We have to pass it like this. If I click on
save if I go here let&apos;s refresh, you can see that we are getting all
the li items. 
So this is now a collection of four elements. 

Next one is document.querySelector. It returns the first element that
matches the specified CSS selector. For example, we have here li and two
class names are green. What I will do is I will say let item, let&apos;s
comment this out. And we will use query selector here and I will say I
want to get the item that is a class of green. 

We have to add a CSS selector as well that is dot for class. Now you may
notice that two of the li classes have class green. And if I do
console.log item it returns only the first li element that has a text of
item one. 

It always returns the first element that matches the specified CSS
selector. 
But then if you want to get all the classes or you can say all the li
items that has a class of green. 

One way was to use get elements by class name. The other method is that
is the last one that is document.querySelectorAll. Here what we can do
is we can say query selector all and we are passing the same green class
here. And now if I do items, if I click on save you will see that
it returns a collection of all the items that match the specified CSS
selector. 

So let&apos;s summarize this. 

We know that the Document Object Model is a tree-like structure that
represents the HTML elements of a web page. 

JavaScript provides various methods to access these elements such
as <span class="consolas">getElementById, getElementsByClassName,
getElementsByTagName, querySelector and querySelectorAll</span>.

Once you have a reference to an element you can modify its
attributes, content and style or create new elements using other methods
that we would be looking at in a separate lesson. 

With these tools you can create dynamic and interactive web pages that
responds to user input and update in real time. 
In the next lesson we will see how to manipulate DOM using JavaScript. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch2-5">2.5 Modifying styles and attributes with JS (6:17)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
In the previous lesson, we learned how to manipulate DOM
elements with JavaScript. 
Now in this lesson we will learn how to modify styles and attributes
using its own methods.

Modifying styles and attributes with
JavaScript allows you to change the appearance and behavior of elements
on a webpage dynamically. 

If you want to modify the styles, you can use style property of an
element to access and modify its CSS styles, and to modify the
attributes you can use set attribute method to add or modify attributes
on an element. 

Let&apos;s understand all these methods and properties through some
examples. 

I&apos;m here in my VS Code, and here we have an index or HTML template
ready with a script tag. We can start writing our code. 
Here, in the body I want to create a <span class="consolas">div</span>, 
inside this <span class="consolas">div</span>, I will have a
<span class="consolas">span tag</span>. 

Let&apos;s give this ID of one and let&apos;s give a name attribute of, let&apos;s
say post. Then we can just write, it is a first spend, this is some
text. Similarly, I want to create one more span and we can give it an ID
of two. Let&apos;s give it a second and second span. 

Now we need to write some JavaScript code. First we can select all the
elements using DOM selectors. I&apos;ll say const live and we can see here
a document.querySelector and you can pass the div. Then we can say const
spanOne and you can make it equal to document.getElementById and we can
pass the ID name as one. 

Similarly, we can do it for two as well. 
We can say spanTwo and this would be two. 
Now let&apos;s start manipulating these tiles and attributes. 
Let&apos;s talk about attributes first. 

If you want to get the attribute, you can say console.log and let&apos;s say
if you want to get the attribute of <span class="consolas">spanOne</span> so we can say 
<span class="consolas">spanOne.getAttribute</span>. 
It is a method, it will take the attributes, we want to get the value of
attribute name. 

If I click on Save, if I go here, refresh, we get the output as
first because the name has the value of forced at this point. 
Let&apos;s say we want to change the name. 
That means setting the attribute. 
We can say <span class="consolas">spanOne.setAttribute</span>. 

This is the method, we can put the attribute name, let&apos;s say name and
the value and the second argument. 

Let&apos;s say a, b, c, d, e, if I click on Save, you will see nothing here
but if you want to see the actual thing that happened, you can go to the
elements section to the body and here inside that div, we will see that
now the name has changed from first to a, b, c, d, e. If you want to
remove the attribute, you can just see <span class="consolas">spanOne.removeAttribute</span> and we
can just remove the attribute of name. 

If I click on &quot;Save,&quot; you will see in this span, we only have the ID
and name has been removed. 

A very short feature is also there that you can just say <span class="consolas">spanOne.id</span> and
rather than using set attribute, you can directly give it an id name of, let&apos;s say 
any text. 
If I click on &quot;Save,&quot; if I go here, you will see that in the body
now seems to this unique word, or letter, you can name it anything. 
You can also change classes using class methods. 

Let&apos;s see if I target <span class="consolas">spanTwo</span> and I can just say 
<span class="consolas">spanTwo.classList.add</span>
and I can add the class, let&apos;s say a new class. 

If I click on &quot;Save,&quot; you will see that in the body under the span div
ID two v gate a class that is new class. 
If you want to remove, you can just say remove, like this and you can
pause the class name that you want to remove. 

You can actually manipulate the styles using a style property. 
Let&apos;s do that as well. 
We can say <span class="consolas">spanOne.style.color</span> and let&apos;s give it red. 
If I click on &quot;Save&quot;, you will see that the text color has changed to
red. 

Similarly, if you want to change the background, you can say
<span class="consolas">spanTwo.style.backgroundColor</span>, you can put any property here and let&apos;s
give it green. 

If I click on Save, you will see that the background of the second span has changed to green. 

Let&apos;s summarize this. 
The style property can be used to access and modify CSS styles of an
element and the classes property can add or remove classes to apply
styles. 

To modify attributes, the second attribute method can add or
change attributes while the get attribute method can retrieve the
attribute values. 

Lastly, we have also seen remove attribute method through which you
can remove an attribute from an element. 

These capabilities allow developers to create interactive webpages that
can respond to user input and change in real-time. 

In the next lesson, we will learn about events and event listeners in
JavaScript.

Event Handling -- What you will learn (0:47)

Hi there. 

In this lesson, you will learn about event handling in JavaScript. 

Event refers to actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, such
as user clicking a button or typing in the form. 

Understanding how to handle events is crucial for creating dynamic
and interactive web pages. 

You will learn about event listeners and how to use them to respond to
user input. 

You will also learn about the common events such as click, mouse hover,
and keypress, and how to use them to create interactive user
interfaces. 

Additionally, you will learn how to handle errors and exceptions that
may arise in your code. 

By the end of this lesson, you will have a solid understanding of how to
handle events in JavaScript, and you will be able to create dynamic
and engaging web pages that responds to user input. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch2-7">2.7 Understanding Events & Event Listeners (3:49)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi there. 
In the previous lesson, we learned how to modify styles and attributes
with JavaScript. 
Now, in this lesson, we will understand events and event listeners. 
So let&apos;s get started. 

Events in JavaScript refers to actions or occurrences that happen on a
web page, such as a mouse click, a keyboard press, or a page load. 
JavaScript provides a way to listen for these events and this point to
them through event listeners. 

Events are important in JavaScript because they allow us to create
dynamic and interactive web pages. 
That means, without events, web pages would be static and unresponsive. 

Events provide a way for users to interact with a web page and for web
pages to react to user input. 
For example, you can consider a web page with a button, in that, when a
user clicks the button, an event is triggered. 

JavaScript can listen for this event and respond by changing the text on
the page or performing some other action. 
Another example is, when a user types something in an input field, an
event is triggered. 

JavaScript can listen for this event and respond by validating the input
or performing some other action. 

To listen for events in JavaScript, we use event listeners. 
Event listeners are functions that are called when a particular event
is triggered. 
We can attach event listeners to the DOM elements using Add Event
Listener method. 

When the event occurs, the event listener function is called, and we can
perform some action in response to the event. 

Let&apos;s look at some common examples of events and how we might use them
in JavaScript. 
First is, click Events. 
So these are triggered when the user clicks an element on the page, such
as a button or a link. 

We can use click events to perform actions like showing or hiding
content, submitting a form, or navigating to a different page. 

Input events, these are triggered when the user types into an input
field or makes a selection in a drop down menu. 

We can use input events to validate user input or update the page in
real time. 
Then we have load events, these are triggered when the page finishes
loading. 
We can use load events to perform actions that depend on the page&apos;s
content being fully loaded, such as fetching data from an API, or
initializing a plugin. 

Then we have, mouseover events, these are triggered when the user hovers
over an element on the page, such as an image or a link. 
We can use mouseover events to add visual effects like toolstips or
hover states. 
These are just a few examples of the many types of events we can use in
JavaScript. 

By using event listeners, we can make our web pages more interactive
and responsive to user actions. 

So let&apos;s summarize this, events in JavaScript refer to actions or
occurrences that happen on a web page, such as mouse click, a keyboard
press, or a page load. 

Events are important in JavaScript because they allows us to create
dynamic and interactive web pages. 

To listen for events in JavaScript, we use event listeners. 
Event listeners are functions that are called when a particular event
is triggered. 
We can attach event listeners to DOM elements using the Add Event
Listener method. 
Overall, events are fundamental part of creating interactive web
pages with JavaScript that allows us to create dynamic and responsive
web experience for the user. 

This is all for this lesson, in the next lesson, we will understand how to
respond to a user input such as click or keypresses events. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch2-8">2.8 Responding to User inputs (clicks, key presses) (6:16)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi there, in the previous lesson we learned events and event listeners
in JavaScript. 

Now in this lesson we will learn how to respond to a user input. 
Let&apos;s get started. 
When building interactive applications or websites, it&apos;s important to
be able to respond to user input such as clicks or key presses to
provide a better user experience. 

This involves using event listeners to detect when a user interacts
with the application and executing specific code in response to those
events. 

Let&apos;s look at some examples.
First we have Click events. 
You can use JavaScript to add event listeners to HTML elements
and detect when they are clicked. 
For example, you could have a button that when clicked, triggers a popup
window to appear. 

Let&apos;s also see one example in VS code.
Here I am in my VS code and I have an index or 
HTML page ready with minimum HTML template with a script tag as well. 
First let&apos;s create a button, and we can give here an ID of, let&apos;s
say, my button, and then we can give it, let&apos;s say, a text of click me.
Next we can go inside the script tag and we can write some JavaScript. 

If I click on save first, we will have a button here.
So what I want is currently you can see nothing is happening. 
I want to attach a click event listener on this button.
What I will do is I will first target the button in the script tag. 
I&apos;ll say const button, you can use any selector you want. 

I will use query selector, so document.queryselector, and we can pass
here the ID of my button like this. 

Next we can attach event listener, so we can say
button.addeventListener. 
It takes two arguments. 
First, the type of the event that is click in our case, and a callback
function.

This callback function runs as soon as it triggers this particular
event. 
At this point I just want to alert, let&apos;s say, hello world. 
If I click on save, if I go here and let&apos;s click on Click Me, and you
can now see that a pop up comes. 
Why? Because it triggers this click event and this callback function
runs that just alerts and print, hello world. 

In this example we are using the Add event listener function to
attach a click event, and then we are passing a callback function that
gets executed when the event is triggered.

Second is key press events. 
You can also detect when a user presses a key on their keyboard
and execute code in response. 
For example, you could have a search box that automatically updates
search results as the user types. 
Let&apos;s create that example as well. 
For that, first of all, we need to have an input field.
Let&apos;s delete all this and let&apos;s create an input field. To this input,
I&apos;ll just give it an ID of, let&apos;s say, search box, and a type of text.

Now in the script tag, we can start writing our JavaScript code. 
Before that you can see the input has already come here on the screen.
We can see here const, search box, and this variable will hold the
element, so we can say document.queryselector. 

And we can pass here the ID as search box.
Next, what we can do is we can just attach an event listener. 
This time the event listener would be key up. 
The event is key up, and on that, that function will run. 
And into this function, you can just write, code to update search
results that would go here. 
Or for now, we can say console log.event triggered.

If I click on save, let&apos;s go to inspect, then to console. 
And here you will see as soon as I press a key, a, event is triggered. 
As soon as I print s, I have not released the key as of now, as soon as
I release the event triggers second time. 

Whenever user release the key, this callback function will run. 
Here in the add event listener function is used to attach a key up
event to the search box input element. 
Whenever the user releases a key while typing in the search box, the
anonymous function passed as the second argument is executed, which
could include the code to update search results. 
Let&apos;s summarize this. 

Responding to user inputs such as clicks and key presses is an essential
part of building interactive applications or websites. 
This involves using event listeners to detect when a user interacts
with the application, and executing specific code in response to those
events.

The examples of how to respond to user input including click events to
trigger a pop up window or maybe using keypress events to update search
results as the user types. 

To implement these functionalities, HTML elements are used to
trigger the events and JavaScript code is used to attach the event
listeners and execute the desired functionality. 

In the next lesson we will create interactive user interfaces with
events. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch2-9">2.9 Creating interactive user interfaces with events (4:59)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi there. In the previous lesson, we learned how to respond to user
input, such as clicks and key pressed event. 
Now in this lesson, we will create an interactive user interface
using events. Let&apos;s get started. 

Creating interactive user interfaces with events is a key part of
building engaging with applications. 

Events are actions that happen in the browser, such as a user clicking a
button or scrolling the page. 

They can be used to trigger specific functionality in your application. 

In this context, events are used to create interactive user interfaces
that respond to user actions in real time. 

Let&apos;s create an interactive interface. 

I&apos;m here in my VS Code and I have a basic HTML setup ready along with
script tag. 

Let&apos;s say that you are building a to-do list application and you want
to allow users to mark items as completed by clicking on the item. 
Let&apos;s see how we can do that. 
First in the body. 
Let&apos;s have an H1 and we can just create our to-do list. 
At this point, there should be coming in the webpage. 

Next we can have some unordered list. 
Inside this, we can have list items. 
Let&apos;s say we want to buy groceries.
You can see we want to do some laundry work.
Or we can have one mode, 
LI item, let&apos;s say clean house. 
We have a to-do list, and we have these three items in our to-do list. 

Next, we will go to our script tag and we can start writing of a
JavaScript tool. 
Here I want to target all of the list items. 
I can use different methods like class name or query selector. 
I will say cost list items. 
Here I will use a document.querySelectorAll. 
You can pass the tax letter here. 
It will target all of the list items. 

Then we can run a loop. 
I can say ListItem.forEach. 
For each item it takes a callback function. 
We want to do something. 
On each item what we want to do is we want to attach an event listener. 
I can say item.addEventListener. 
The type of event would be click. 

Then we want to run a callback function.

Here we will say item.classList.toggle. 

We will add a class that is completed. 

Toggle means just like us on and off button. 
If the class is there it will remove it. 
If the class is not there, it will add it. 
We are talking about a completed class. 
We have to create this class. 
What we can do is below the title, we can have a style tag and we can
say.completed. 
We can say text decoration to be line through. 

We can give it a color of gray as well. 
If I click on &quot;Save&quot; Let&apos;s test it out. 
If I go here, if I click on, let&apos;s say buy groceries, it cuts. 
It has a line through here as well, here as well. 
When we click on again, since it already has the class, it will remove
it. 

This is how you can create interactive applications using JavaScript. 
In this example, the HTML page contains an unordered list with three
to-do items. 

When a user clicks on the to-do item an event listener is triggered
that toggles a CSS class on the item, causing it to be displayed with a
line through and a gray color. 

The CSS class is defined here in the head of the HTML using the style
tag. 
Let&apos;s summarize this. 
Using events is a crucial part of creating interactive user interfaces
in web applications, events can be used to detect user actions, such as
clicks and key presses, and trigger specific functionality in response. 

By using event listeners to handle user input, web developers can create
engaging and dynamic applications that provide a seamless user
experience. 
We have seen some examples of how events can be used to create
interactive features in real-world applications. Such as to-do list
app.

Javascript has events to provide a dynamic interface to a webpage. These
events are hooked to elements in the Document Object Model(DOM).

These events by default use bubbling propagation i.e, upwards in the DOM
from children to parent. We can bind events either as inline or in an
external script.

Advanced DOM Manipulation (what you will learn) (0:59)
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
In this lesson, we will dive deeper into manipulating the Document
Object Model with JavaScript. 
You will learn how to create and remove DOM element dynamically using
JavaScript. 

This will enable you to build more interactive and dynamic web
applications that can respond to user input and change their content
dynamically. 

You will also learn about AJAX, a powerful technique that allows you to
load content dynamically from a server without refreshing the entire
page. 
This is a crucial skill for building fast and responsive Web
applications that can update their content without interrupting the
user&apos;s experience. 

Finally, you will learn about handling errors and exception in
JavaScript. 
This is an important skill for writing robust and error free code, as it
allows you to detect and handle unexpected errors that might occur
during runtime. 

You will learn how to use try-catch blocks to catch and handle
errors, as well as best practices for debugging and testing your code. 
Creating and removing DOM elements with JS (6:36)

Hi there. In this lesson, we will learn how to create and remove DOM
elements with JavaScript in retail. Let&apos;s get started. 
Creating and removing DOM elements with JavaScript is a fundamental
technique using web development to dynamically modify the content of web
pages. 

JavaScript provides a variety of methods for creating and manipulating
DOM elements, including createElement, appendChild, append, remove,
removeChild, and so on. 

Let&apos;s understand this using an example. 
Let&apos;s go to the VS Code and here I have a basic HTML template ready. 
We would also need to have a script tag so that we can write our
JavaScript code. 

Let&apos;s create a basic template first. 

Let&apos;s say we are creating an H1 and let&apos;s say we&apos;re listing some
favorite foods.
My favorite foods. 
Then we can have an unordered list and we can give you idea of food
list. 

Here we can have list items. 
Let&apos;s see, we have pizza and we have, let&apos;s say sushi as well. 
Noteworthy will do is we will create two buttons. 
Let&apos;s give this an ID of addButton.
As the ID use suggests, we will add items to it so we can say add
Tacos. 
Similarly, we can create one more button and we can see here
removeButton.

As the name suggests, it removes. 
We can say at this point, remove sushi. 
Now we can start writing our JavaScript code. 
If I click on Save, you will see that all of the operators coming here
on the webpage, and let&apos;s manipulate it, create and remove some items
from it. 

Let&apos;s select the elements using DOM selectors. 
I&apos;ll say const addButton. 
We can make it equal to document.querySelector and we can just put here
ID, so ID is #addButton. 
Similarly, what we can do is we can target our removeButton as well. 
We can just copy-paste at this point and similarly, we can target our
food list. 
Let&apos;s say const foodList and it would be again equal to
document.querySelector. 
We can pass the ID here like this. 

Now what we want to do is we want to attach event listener. 
I can say addButton.addEventListener and let&apos;s have an event of
type click and then we can run a callback function. 
Inside this function, we will say const newListItem. 
Here we can say document.createElement and we want to create a new li
element like this. 

Then let&apos;s say const newListItemText and you can create it using a
method that is document.create, and that is TextNode. 
We want to pass it let&apos;s say, Tacos. 
Then what we want to do is after that, we can say newListItem.append, or
you can use append child and we want to say newListItemText. 

Then what you want to do is we want to see foodList.appendChild, this
time let&apos;s use this and you want to append newListItem. 
Now if I click on Save, if we try to run this, you will see that when we
say Add Tacos, it adds it to the list based on the event. 

Similarly, let&apos;s create it for removeButton as well. 
Let&apos;s put here removeButton and that is again a type of click and you
want to do some things here. 
We can say const sushi to be document.querySelector and we can say
target li, that has an nth child of two. 

Then what we can do is we can either use removedChild or remove. 
Let&apos;s use removedChild at this point, we can say removeChild and you
want to remove the sushi. 
Now if I click on Save, 
let&apos;s test both of them. 
I will refresh. It adds tacos and it removes the sushi. 
In this example, there are two buttons. 
One that adds a new list item containing the text tacos to the unordered
list, and one that removes the second item containing the text sushi
from the unordered list. 
The event listeners for both buttons use querySelector method to
access the appropriate DOM elements. 

Then we use appendChild or append, or you can say remove a removeChild
method to create or remove elements from the DOM respectively. 
Let&apos;s summarize this. 
In web development, creating and removing DOM elements with JavaScript
is a fundamental technique used to dynamically modify the content of web
pages. 

By using the methods like createElement, appendChild, removeChild, web
developers can create dynamic and responsive web pages that provide a
rich and engaging user experience for the users. 
In the next lesson, we will see how to use Ajax to load content
dynamically. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch2-12">2.12 Using AJAX to load content dynamically (7:03)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
In the previous lesson, we learned how to create a new move DOM
elements using JavaScript. 
Now in this lesson, we will learn how to use AJAX to load content
dynamically. Let&apos;s get started. 

AJAX or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML is a technique used in web
development to load content dynamically without requiring a full page
refresh. 

This technique allows webpages to load new content or data from the
server in the background without interrupting the user&apos;s
current interaction with the page. 

To use AJAX in a webpage, we typically use the XMLHttpRequest object in
JavaScript to send an HTTP request to the server and then process the
response using JavaScript. 

We can use this technique to load content from the server and display it
on the webpage without having to reload the entire page. 
Let&apos;s look at an example of how to use 
AJAX to load content dynamically from a server. 
Let&apos;s go to the VS Code, and here I have a basic HTML file ready. 

Let&apos;s start creating a basic template here. 
Let&apos;s say I wanted H1 and in this H1, you can just give it a heading
off, let&apos;s say users. 
Then we can just have an unordered list. 
Let&apos;s give it an ID of user list. 
Let&apos;s leave it empty for now. 
Next, what we will do is we need to write JavaScript now. 

We&apos;ll go inside the script tag and we can capture this user list using
DOM selector. 
Lets say const userList equals to document.querySelector. 
We can pass the ID, that is hash userList. 
Then you can say const xhr. 

We can create this new XML request object. 
It is XMLHttpRequest and we can create an object like this. 
Next what we want to do is we can say xhr and we need to have an event
that is on ready state change. 
On this, we need to run a function. 
Let&apos;s use a function here. 

We can say if xhr.readyState is equal to XML httprequest.done, in that
case, we want to have one more if condition. 
Here we can say if xhr.status is 200, that means we got the response
successfully. 
We can say const, userData. 
At this point, we can parse it. We can parse what? 
We can parse the response text that we&apos;re getting from xhr object. 
We can say responseText here.
Next, what we want to do is we can say userData and we want to loop
through it. 

We can say for each.
Here we can get a single user and then you want to run this callback
function for every single user. 
Then you want to say const, newUser. 
You want to create an LI element for it. 
We can say document.create element. 
The element that you wanted to create is LI. 
After that, we can say const, newUser let&apos;s say text. 
This would be equal to document.CreateTextNode.

The node we want to create is coming from user that is named. 
Let&apos;s use the name as the text that we want to append. 
Now we can see newUser.appendChild, and let&apos;s append newUserText. 
Then we can say userList.appendChild, and let&apos;s open a newUser. 
This is for the if condition. 
What if you want to have an else condition as well? 
After this, we can just say else.
We can say console.log.
We can say there was a problem with the request, something like that, an
error message. 

After that, what we want to do is we want to make the request so we can
say xhr.open. 
We want to make a request of Typekit and you want to pass the URL. 
The URL that we would be using is from JSON typi code. 
You can search for jsontypicode.com. 
Here we want the endpoint as /users. 
Here you can see we will get a list of users. 
Let&apos;s copy it and let&apos;s paste it here. 
Then what we want to do is we just need to say xhr.send that will send
the request. 
If I click on &quot;Save&quot;, we should get a user list here in the webpage. 
This means it is working perfectly fine. 

In this example, we use AJAX to load a list of users from the JSON
Placeholder API and we are displaying them on the webpage. 
We start by using XMLHttpRequest object to create a new HttpRequest and
then we define a callback function to handle the response when it is
received from the server. 

Now, when the response is received, we check the status of the response
to make sure that it was successfull. 
Then we parse it using JSON.parse the response data into a JavaScript
object. 
Finally, we loop through them and dynamically create LI elements for
each user, which are then appended to the userList that is UL on the
webpage. 
Let&apos;s summarize this. 
Overall, using AJAX to load content dynamically from APIs is a powerful
technique that can greatly enhance the user experience of the pages by
allowing them to load new content in the background without requiring a
full page refresh. 

In the next lesson we will see how to handle errors and exceptions in
JavaScript. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch2-13">2.13 Handling Errors and Exceptions (5:53)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi there. In the previous lesson, we learned how to use Ajax to load
content dynamically. 

Now in this lesson, we will learn how to handle errors and exceptions in
JavaScript. Let&apos;s get started. 

Handling errors and exception is an important part of writing robust and
reliable JavaScript code. 
In JavaScript, we have try and catch keywords that are used together to
handle errors and exceptions in the code. 

Here is the basic syntax of try and catch block. 
The try block contains the code that may potentially throw an error or
exception. 
If an error occurs, JavaScript will jump out of the try block and into
the catch block. 
The catch block contains code that will handle the error or
exception such as logging an error message or taking corrective action. 

Within the catch block, you will also notice this error variable. 
This error variable is used to represent the error object that was
thrown. 
This variable can be used to access information about the error, such as
its message, stack trace, and any additional data that may be attached
to it. 

Let&apos;s understand this through an example. 
Let&apos;s go to the VS Code. 
Here I have a file that is a JavaScript file handlingErrors.js. 
Let&apos;s start writing a code at this point. 
Let&apos;s create a function divide and this function will take a numerator
and you can see denominator as the parameter. 

Then what you want to do is, we can add a check here. 
We can say if denominator is equal, equal to zero, in that
case, division is not possible. 
What we want to do is we want to throw new error. 
This will throw a new object. 
We can pass a message here. 

We can say division by zero. 
You can pass any error related to it. 
At this point, it seems more appropriate. 
Then what we want to do is we can say return numerator divided by
denominator. 
This is the function. 

Then you want to call a function. 
But before calling the function, we will use try and catch to check for
any errors. 
We can say try this piece of this block of code. 
We can say const result, and result would be a part of, let&apos;s say
divide. 
Whatever divide this returning, you can show it in result. 
We will pass here 10, 0 because we want to get an error. 
Then we can say console.log result. 

As you can see, it is throwing some error that catcher finally
expected. 
It is always important to use catch method at this point. 
We can say catch error.

We can see console.log error. 
It is an object and we want to put a message at this point. 
We can say error.message.
Let&apos;s try to run this program. 
I&apos;ve clicked on &quot;Save&quot; and let&apos;s open up the terminal. 
Let&apos;s clear it and let&apos;s run node handlingErrors.js. 

You can see we get the message here that is division by zero. 
Also right here something like this to actually give more idea about
that this is an error rather than a normal message. 
If I try to run this again, you can see it says error division by zero. 

In this example we define a function divide that performs a division
operation on two numbers, that is numerator and denominator. 
Before performing the division, we checked to make sure that the
denominator is not zero. 

If it is, we throw a new error object with a custom error message that
is error division by zero in this case. 
We then call the divide function with arguments 10 and 0 within a try
block. 

Since this will result in a divide-by-zero error, JavaScript will jump
out of the try block into the catch block. 
Within the catch block, we log the error message to the console using
console.log error.message. 

That&apos;s all we are getting the output here. 
Let&apos;s summarize this. 
In JavaScript, try and catch are used together to handle errors and
exceptions in the code. 

The try block contains the code that may potentially throw an error or
exception, and the catch block contains code that will handle the error
or exception. 

Within the catch block, the error variable is used to represent the
error object that was thrown. 

This variable can be used to access information about the error such
as its message or maybe stack trace and any additional data that may be
attached to it. 

Using try-catch blocks can help us write more reliable and maintainable
JavaScript code by gracefully handling errors and exceptions.

**Using AJAX to load content dynamically**

Ajax is not a technology, but rather a programming concept. HTML and CSS
can be used in combination to mark up and style information. The webpage
can be modified by JavaScript to dynamically display---and allow the
user to interact with the new information. The built-in XMLHttpRequest
object is used to execute Ajax on webpages, allowing websites to load
content onto the screen without refreshing the page. Ajax is not a new
technology, nor is it a new language. Instead, it is existing
technologies used in a new way.

<h3 id="ch3-2">3.2 Working with Arrays and Objects in JavaScript (8:18)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi, there. In this lesson, we will learn about arrays and objects in
JavaScript. Let&apos;s get started. 
Let&apos;s first talk about arrays in JavaScript. 
An array is a data structure in JavaScript that allows you to
store multiple values in a single variable. 

It can hold values of any data type such as: numbers, strings, Booleans,
or even other arrays. 
Arrays are zero-indexed. 
That means the first element is at Index 0, the second would be at Index
1, and then so on. 
Let&apos;s understand working with arrays with the help of an example. 

Here, I&apos;m in my VS Code and I have a basic index.html page, linked with
index.js file. 
Let&apos;s first start by creating an array. 

We can say let fruits, and we can create an array using the square
brackets and we can put multiple items here, let&apos;s say array of
strings. 

We can say apple. 
Let&apos;s put banana, and then we can put orange as well. 
This is how you can create an array. 

If you do console.log fruits, you will get array into the console. 
Let&apos;s go to Inspect and console. 
You can see that we have array with three strings, that is apple,
banana, and orange and you can see the index starts from zero. 

Apple&apos;s index is 0, banana is 1, and orange is 2. 
You can access the element based on the index. 
If I say fruits at Index 0, so guess the output, the output would be
apple here. 

If I do, let&apos;s say 2, it would be orange, as you can see here. 
If you want to modify an array element, let&apos;s say we can do something
like fruits add index 1 and I just want to put, let&apos;s say, grape here. 
Let&apos;s console it again. 

I can say console.log fruits. 
At this point, you will see that at Index 1, we have grape now, if you
want to check a length of the array, you can do it by using a.length
property like this, it will give you the length of the array that is
three in this case. 
You can do a lot of things using array methods and properties. 
We&apos;re just seeing the important ones and the commonly used. 
Let&apos;s also see how we can add elements to this array. 
We can say fruits. 

There is a method called push that push the elements into the end of the
array. 
Let&apos;s say we want to push mango and if I do console.log fruits
again, you will see that the mango has been added at Index 3. 
If you want to pop or remove the last element, you can use a method that
is pop. 

We can say,.pop mango or you don&apos;t have to mention here anything
because it will directly remove the last element and if I console log
groups again, you will see that first it had mango and then when we use
pop, it popped off from the array. 

Of course, there are a couple of more methods that you can use, but
these are the common ones. 

You can also iterate the array using a for loop. 
We can say for let i to be zero, we want to iterate
through fruits.length and then we can say i++. 
In this case, if I do console.log fruits at index I, you will see that
it has iterated over all of the strings and printed in the console. 

Now let&apos;s talk about objects in JavaScript. 
Objects in JavaScript are more complex data types that allows you to
store key-value pairs. 

They can not represent real-world entities or concepts and provide a way
to organize related data and functionality together. 
Objects have properties that is called as keys and corresponding
values, which can be of any data type. 
Let&apos;s now try to understand objects using an example. 

Let me remove this code and let&apos;s create a person object. 
Just like we create an array using a square bracket, we can create an
object using curly brackets. 
Then we can create a key. 
Let&apos;s say the name of the person is John. 

Then it can have any number of attributes, let&apos;s say age to be 25. 
Then we can say is a student so that would be true in this case. 
Again, it can hold any data type. 

As you can see, we&apos;re holding string, number, and Boolean, although you
can have areas and objects here as well. 
How to access the properties? 
You can just say console.log and we can say person.name. 

This is one notation that is dot notation and when we say
person.name, you will get John printed here. 
There is one more way to access the properties using a square bracket
notation. 
We can just say square bracket here and we can pass the key age. 
If I write this syntax, you will see we get the age here as well in the
console. 
Let&apos;s say we want to modify the properties here so we can see
person.age to be 30. 

Then we can say console.log person.age. 

Earlier it was 25 now you can see the age has been changed to 30. 

You can add more properties to it. 

Let&apos;s say if I want to add a city of the person, so let&apos;s say
person.city to be, let&apos;s say, New York.

Now if I do something like console.log person, you will see that last
console brings all the properties, including new property, that is city
as well. 

If you want to iterate over the properties of an object you can use a
for in loop. 

You can say for let key in the person object. 

It will iterate to all of the keys and then we can say print or
console.log p plus, let say some colon. 

Then you can say plus person and square bracket key. 

If I click on &quot;Save,&quot; you can see that key will give you name, age
isStudent, and city and this gives you the values, and in-between we
have colons here. 

This is how you can iterate over the properties. 

In this example, an object person is created with properties like name,
age, and isStudent. 

Then we have access using dot notation and back-end notation as well
and you can also modify existing properties by assigning new values and
add new properties to an object dynamically. 

Let&apos;s summarize this. 

Arrays and objects are powerful data structures in JavaScript that
enable you to organize, manipulate, and represent complex data. 

Understanding how to work with arrays and objects is crucial for
handling data. 

In the next lesson, we will understand about closures and scope chain in
JavaScript. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch3-3">3.3 Understanding Closures and the Scope Chain (11:42)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi there. In the previous lesson, we learned about arrays and objects in
JavaScript. 

Now in this lesson we will understand closures and scope chain. 

Let&apos;s get started. 
Before diving into closures, let&apos;s first understand what is scope. 

Scope in JavaScript refers to the visibility and accessibility of
variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code
during runtime. 
JavaScript has function scope which means that variables defined within
a function are only accessible within that function. 

This concept helps with variable encapsulation and prevents naming
conflicts. 
Let&apos;s understand the scope using an example. 
Let&apos;s go to the Vs code I have index HTML and index JS file linked
to each other, and let&apos;s create a function called great.

In this function, let&apos;s create a message using const and here we can
put let&apos;s say Hello at this point. 
If I do something like console log message, and let&apos;s call great
here, if I click on save, let&apos;s go to inspect and to console. 

You can see that we get the output as Hello. 
But if after the greed I try to log this message, you will see that
error. 
That message is not defined. 
In this example the message variable is defined within the great
function. 
It is accessible and can be used within this function only. 

However, if you try to access this outside of the function like
this, you will receive an error because the variable is not defined in
that scope. 
Now we can move to the part of closures. 
Closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment
within which that function was declared. 

It allows a function to access variables from its outer scope, even
after the outer function has finished executing. 

This is a very important concept, so let&apos;s try to understand this using
an example. 
Here what we can do is, we can create a function and let&apos;s give the
name as outer.

Now into this function, we can create a variable and let&apos;s call it as
outer variable.

And I can just put up a value here or a string here that I am from
outer, something like that. 
And then inside this, we can create a function inner.
And here we can say console.log outer variable.
And then after this function we can just return this inner function at
this point.
Now we can say const closureFunction.

And let&apos;s put outer and call the outer function here. 
Outer function is called here and it will return inner function into
this closure function variable, and then what we can do is, we can call
this closure function like this.

If I click on Save you will see that we get the output I am from
outer. 
In this example, the outer function defines a variable called outer
variable here. 

It also declares an inner function within it, the inner function has
access to the outer variable even though it is declared inside the outer
function. 
When outer function is invoked and assigned to the closure function
variable, it returns the inner function. 

Even though at this point the outer function has finished executing,
closure function still retains access to the outer variable through
something called closure. 
When closure function is called, it locks the value of outer variable
at this point. 

If you want to test this out, you can also go to sources to index.js
and where we are consoling it here.
Let&apos;s put a debugger at this point and click on Refresh. 

Now you can see that this particular function forms a closure with the
outer function, and that&apos;s how it is able to access the outer variable
even though the outer function was finished executing. 

Closures are useful for preserving data privacy and creating private
variables. 

They allow you to create functions that can access and manipulate
specific data, while keeping that data inaccessible from outside of the
function. 

Now let&apos;s move to another important topic, that is scope chain. 

The scope chain is the hierarchy of scopes in which variables
and functions are accessible. 

It is created during the lexical analysis phase of code execution. 
When a variable or function is referenced, JavaScript searches for it in
the current scope. If it doesn&apos;t find it, it continues searching in the
outer scope, and this process continues until the variable or function
is found or until the global scope is reached. 

Let&apos;s understand the scope chain using an example.
We can create a function again with the name outer, and inside this,
we can say const outervariable, and let&apos;s put the value as outer string
here. 

And inside this we can create a function inner, and then we can say
const innervariable, and let&apos;s put the value as inner. 

And then we can say console.log innervariable and we can put some space
here, and then we can say plus then outervariable. 

And after this we can call our inner function, and after this we can
call our outer function.

Let&apos;s see the output first. 
If we go here, let&apos;s remove the debugger and let&apos;s refresh it
again, you can see that we get the output as inner and outer. 

So in this example, the inner function has access to both the inner
variable and the outer variable. 

This is possible because the inner function is within the scope of the
outer function. 
It can access variables in both its scope and outer scope as well. 

Let&apos;s summarize this. 

Understanding closures and the scope chain is crucial for writing
JavaScript code that effectively uses variable encapsulation, maintains
data privacy, and leverages the flexibility of different scopes. 

With these concepts you can create powerful and modular JavaScript
applications. 

In the next lesson we will understand about debugging in JavaScript. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch3-4">3.4 Debugging JavaScript Code (7:51)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
In the previous lesson, we learned about closures and the scope chain in
JavaScript. Now in this lesson, we will understand how to debug
JavaScript code. 

Let&apos;s get started. 
Debugging JavaScript code is an important skill for developers to
identify and fix errors or issues in their code. 
Let&apos;s look at some debugging concepts and techniques in JavaScript. 

Identifying errors, so when you encounter an error in your JavaScript
code, the browser&apos;s console is a useful tool for identifying and
understanding the error. 
The console provides information about the error type, the line number
where the error occurred, and any accompanying error messages. 

You can just console these statements. 
Let&apos;s go to the VS Code, and here I have index.js and index.html
file linked together, and you can directly use a console.log
statement, and you can log anything that would be printed in the
console. 

If I click on Save, I have already opened index.html with live
server. 
Let&apos;s go to Inspect and Console, and you can see the console statements
here. 

When running this code, the browser&apos;s console will display an error
message, indicating a syntax error and the line number where the error
occurred if there is any error. 

For example, if I do something like this, you can see that it displays a
type error at this point. 
Next is to use console statements. 
Console statements are helpful for debugging code by printing values
or messages to the console. 

They actually allow you to see the state of variables or the flow of
execution at specific points in your code. 

For example, let&apos;s create a function and let&apos;s call it as multiply. 

This would take parameters a,b, and then we can say
onsole.log(&apos;Multiplying&apos;, a, &quot;and&quot;, b);. 

Then, we can say return a &ast; b;. 

After that, let&apos;s create a result variable, And let&apos;s invoke the
function multiply(5,2,); and let&apos;s also say console.log(&apos;Result: &apos;,
result);. 

In this example, the console.log statement is used to display
messages and the values of the variables during the execution of the
multiply function. 

By inspecting the console output, you can verify if the function is
receiving the correct values and producing the expected result. 
If I click on Save, you will see that we are getting Multiplying 5
and 2, and the result is 10.

Next technique is to set breakpoints. 
Setting breakpoints in your code allows you to pause the execution
at specific lines enabling you to examine the state of variables
and step through the code line by line. 

Most modern web browsers provide developer tools with built-in debugging
features including setting breakpoints.

For this particular case, let&apos;s modify the example and we can say let
result = a &ast; b; and then we can say return the result;. 
Next, we are just calling this multiply function storing the result in
the result variable and then logging the result again. 

But just before returning the result, I will just add debugger key here,
and this will pause the code. 

In this example, this debugger statement is added to pause the
execution at that line. 

When you open this browser tools now, you can see the code has been
stopped and it allows us to inspect the variables in step to the code
and analyze the program&apos;s flow. 
You can see that at this point, a is 5, b is 2, and the result is 10.

Last but not the least, we can read error messages. 

When encountering an error, JavaScript provides error messages that
can offer clues about the issue. 

Understanding and interpreting these error messages can help you
identify the problem and fix it. 

Let&apos;s try to create an error, so what we can do here is we can
say function divide(a, b). 

Then, we can say if(b === 0) {throw new Error(&apos;Cannot divide by zero&apos;
); as this is not possible. 

And after this if this condition is false, we can just return A / b;. 

Next, we can say try and into this try block, we can say let result =
divide(10,0);. 
And let&apos;s create an error, so we can say console.log(&apos;Result: &apos;,
result);. 

And we can also have a catch, so it will catch for any errors, and then
we can say console.log(&apos;Error: &apos;,error.message).
In this particular example, the divide function throws an error if
the second argument b is 0. 
When running this code, an error is thrown, so let&apos;s check that
out. 

Let&apos;s refresh, and you can see in the console, we have error cannot
divide by zero, and here the catch block is executed. 
The error message can be accessed using this error.message property that
allows you to display custom error messages or handle errors gracefully,
so let&apos;s summarize this. 

By understanding these debugging techniques and concepts, beginners can
effectively identify and resolve issues in their JavaScript code. 
Debugging plays a vital role in development process and helps improve
the functionality and quality of your JavaScript applications.

**Working with arrays and objects in JavaScript**

Arrays are generally described as &quot;list-like objects&quot;; they are
basically single objects that contain multiple values stored in a list.
Array objects can be stored in variables and dealt with in much the same
way as any other type of value, the difference being that we can access
each value inside the list individually, and do super useful and
efficient things with the list, like loop through it and do the same
thing to every value.

**Understanding closures and the scope chain**
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Scope is the context environment (also known as lexical environment)
created when a function is written. This context defines what other data
it has access to.

Closures are the best form of privacy for functions and variables. This
is evident in the use of many module patterns. A module pattern returns
an object to expose a public API. It also keeps other methods and
variables private. Closures are used in event handling and callbacks.

Intro to jQuery -- What you will learn (1:18)

Hi there. In this lesson, you will learn about basics of jQuery, a
popular JavaScript library that makes it easier to work with HTML
documents. 

We will start with introduction to jQuery, where you will learn what
jQuery is and why it is useful for web development. 

You will also learn how to include jQuery in your web pages and how to
use it to manipulate the DOM. 

Next, we will cover jQuery selectors, which allows you to select
and manipulate HTML elements in your web pages. 

You will learn how to use CSS style selectors to find and select
elements in the DOM and how to manipulate their attributes and
properties using jQuery. 

After that, we will dive into jQuery effects, which allows you to
animate and add visual effects to your web pages. 

You will learn how to use jQuery to create smooth animations, feed
elements in and out, and change the visibility of the elements in the
page. 

Finally, we will explore jQuery traversal, which allows you to move up
and down the DOM tree to find and select elements. 

You will learn how to use jQuery to traverse the DOM and select elements
based on their relationships to other elements on the page. 

By the end of this lesson, you will have a good understanding of the
basics of jQuery and how to use it to create interactive and dynamic web
pages. 

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch3-6">3.6 What is jQuery? (5:01)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
In this lesson we will learn about what is jQuery. Let&apos;s get
started. 
jQuery is a popular, fast and lightweight JavaScript library that is
designed to simplify client side web development. 

It provides a range of features and functionalities that makes it easier
to manipulate HTML elements, handle events, perform animations, make
AJAX request, and much more. 

jQuery is built on top of JavaScript and offers a simplified syntax and
cross-browser compatibility, making it widely used in web development. 

Let&apos;s try to consider an analogy to understand jQuery. 
Imagine that you have a toolbox filled with various tools that help you
perform specific task. 
Each tool serves a different purpose and make your work easier. 

In this analogy, JavaScript is like a general purpose tool, while jQuery
is a specialized tool that focuses on specific tasks related to web
development. 

Just as you would reach for a specific tool in your toolbox to perform a
specific task efficiently, you can read for jQuery to simplify and
streamline common web development task, such as selecting and
manipulating HTML elements, handling events, and make AJAX requests. 

Another thing you can imagine is that you are visiting a foreign country
where you don&apos;t speak the native language. 

However, you have a translator who can help you communicate
effectively. 

In this anthology, JavaScript is like the native language and jQuery
acts as the translator that simplifies and bridges the gap between
JavaScript and HTML. 

Just as the translator helps you understand and communicate with the
locals in the language, jQuery act as a translator between JavaScript
and HTML, making it easier for developers to write code that interacts
with and manipulates HTML elements. 

Let&apos;s look at some key features of jQuery, DOM manipulation. 

jQuery simplifies the process of selecting and manipulating HTML
elements in the document object model, often called as DOM. 
It provides a concise syntax for accessing and modifying elements such
as changing their content, attributes, or CSS styles. 

With jQuery, you can easily create dynamic and interactive web pages. 
Even handling: jQuery makes it easier to handle browser events such as
clicks, key presses, mouse movements, and form submissions. 

It provides methods to attach event handlers to elements, and execute
code when that particular event occurs. 
This allows you to enhance user interactivity and respond to user
actions effectively. 

Animations and effects: jQuery offers a wide range of animations and
effects that can be applied to HTML elements. 
You can create smooth transitions, fields, slides, and other visually
appealing effects using simple jQuery methods. 
This enables you to add engaging in emissions to your web pages without
complex JavaScript coding. 
AJAX: jQuery simplifies the process of making asynchronous requests to
the server and handling the responses without requiring a page reload. 

It provides a set of AJAX methods makes it easier to fetch data from a
server, send data, and update parts of a webpage dynamically. 
AJAX allows for seamless and interactive user experiences. 

Cross-browser compatibility: One of jQuery&apos;s significant advantages
is its ability to handle cross-browser compatibility issues. 
It provides a consistent API that works across different web
browsers, reducing the need to write browser specific code. 

This ensures that your web application functions reliably and
consistently across various platforms. 
Last but not the least, plugin integration. 

jQuery has a vast ecosystem of plugins contributed by the community. 
These plugins extend jQuery&apos;s functionality and allows you
to incorporate additional features and behaviors into your web
projects. 

You can find plugins for things like sliders, carousels, form
validation, date pickers, and much more. Let&apos;s summarize this. 

Overall jQuery is a versatile library that simplifies many common tasks
in web development. 
Its application span from basic DOM manipulation and event handling to
more advanced features like AJAX request animation effects. 

By using jQuery, developers can write concise, cross-browser compatible
code and create rich and interactive web experiences with less effort. 
In the next lesson, we will understand about selectors. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch3-7">3.7 jQuery Selectors (7:39)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi there. In the previous lesson we learned about what is jQuery. 
Now in this lesson we will understand jQuery selectors, so let&apos;s get
started. 
jQuery selectors are a powerful feature that allows you to target and
select HTML elements in the DOM. 

They provide a concise and efficient way to identify elements based on
various criteria, such as element types, classes, IDs, attributes, and
more. 
Let&apos;s look at some commonly used jQuery selectors. 
We have element selector, so it selects elements based on their tag
name. 

You can use tag names like div, p, h1, etc, to select specific
elements. 
Then we have a class selector where you can select the elements based on
any class. 
Then we have an ID selector you can select the element with its unique
ID and then we have attribute selectors, so you can select an element
based on its attribute and you can also combine all these selectors and
pick up a single element. 
Let&apos;s try to understand all of them using examples. 
Let&apos;s go to the VS Code, and here I have index.html file ready where I
have a bunch of HTML tags and this is the output as of now. 

We have h1, two p tags with a class of highlight, some div with class of
boxes, two links, then again headings; h2s and h3s, then input with
attributes, then we have buttons and a form. 
Now we have to select them based on jQuery selectors. 
Let&apos;s start by simple element selector. 

If I want to select let&apos;s say a p tag, so we&apos;re using a p tag here and
what we can do is we can say dollar and we can pass a p tag here. 
We can say dot text and we can change the text to, let&apos;s say this
text is changed using jQuery, something like that. 

Now if I click on &quot;Save&quot;, you will see that both of the p tags text is
changed. 
This is cool, this is what is called as an element selector where you
pick up the elements based on their tag names. 

Here we have picked up p. If you want to pick h1, you can say h1, h2,
and h3. The problem here is that it will pick all the elements, all the
p tags from the particular HTML page. 
We want to create or we want to select a unique element based either on
the class or an ID, or you can say attribute. 
Let&apos;s look at those examples as well. 

Let&apos;s say if I want to select elements with the class of highlight, so
we can say dollar and we can pass the name of the class in quotes,
let&apos;s say &quot;.highlight&quot;. 
Then we can say.css and you want to change the color to let&apos;s say red. 

Now if I click on &quot;Save&quot; you will see that the color of this
particular paragraph or the particular element with the class of
highlight, the text color has been changed and you can see this p tag
only has the class of highlight. 
Let&apos;s select the element based on the ID. 

What we can do is let&apos;s say dollar and the ID is my elements. 
Just like you say.class, you say #ID. 
#MyElement and then we can say.hide. 
Let&apos;s see if we have an element by MyElement ID, so we don&apos;t have it. 
What we can do is we can give here this p tag an ID of my element and
let&apos;s click on &quot;Save&quot;. 

Let&apos;s go here. You can see that the second paragraph or that element
that had the ID of my element has been hidden. 
Let&apos;s look at attribute selector, so you can select elements based on
their attributes and attribute values. Let&apos;s try that. 

What we can do here is we can say dollar and we want to target the input
element, and the attribute of that would come in the square brackets, so
let&apos;s say required. 

Now you can see that we have three inputs here out of which first and
third has the required attribute. 

We want to pick them and we want to add a new class and that class
would be let&apos;s say required-field. 
Now if I click on &quot;Save&quot; you will see that they have this required
field added here. 
This required-field we have already created here, so it has just the
border of 2px solid and red. 

You can see that only those required; that is one and third, have been
given the borders. 
This is what is called as an attribute selector. 

Next we can look at combination of selectors, or you can say in easier
words, combining selectors. 
You can combine multiple selectors to target elements that meet specific
criteria. 

For example, you can combine class and elements selectors or
use multiple selectors separated by comma. 
We have here anchor tag. 
Here, let&apos;s do what? Let&apos;s target them. 
We can say dollar and let&apos;s put here a.nav-link.
What is this nav-link? 
This nav-link is the class. 
We are combining here the tag selector and the class selector, and then
we can say.addClass and let&apos;s add an active class. 

If I click on &quot;Save&quot; you will see in both the elements we now have the
active class. 
An active class is created here or it&apos;s not created, so we can
say.active and let&apos;s give it a background of green. 

If I click on &quot;Save&quot;, you can see that we have navigation links and
let&apos;s target that again. 
We have.active here, it should be ve. 
Now you can see that both have been given the background color. 

These are just few examples of jQuery selectors, there are many more
selectors options available such as parent-child relationships, sibling
relationships, form related selectors, and much more. 
jQuery selector syntax is designed to closely reassemble CSS
selectors, making it easy to grasp and use for selecting elements. 

In the next lesson, we will learn about jQuery effects. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h3 id="ch3-8">3.8 jQuery Effects (6:31)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi there. In the previous lesson, we learned about jQuery selectors. 
Now in this lesson we will learn jQuery effects. Let&apos;s get started. 

jQuery effects allows you to add visual transitions and animations to
HTML elements. 
Effects can make your webpages more engaging and interactive by
providing smooth transitions, fades, slides, and other animations. 
Let&apos;s understand this through an example. 
Let&apos;s go to the VS Code and I have index.html file we created here. 

Let&apos;s have a basic template and let&apos;s say intitled to jQuery effects
and let&apos;s have an h1 for now of let&apos;s say effect. 
If I click on Save, we should get effect as the output here. 
Let&apos;s change it to effects example. 

You have what the structure would be is, let&apos;s have a button and to
this button, let&apos;s give a text of a toggle box. 
We will create a toggle example here and then you can have a div. 
Let&apos;s give this an id of myBox and we can also give it a class of box
like this and that&apos;s it. 

Let&apos;s leave it empty. Now let&apos;s take this box and here we can have a
style tag, so let&apos;s say dot box, and we can give it a width of, let&apos;s
say, 200 pixels and a height of 200 pixels as well. 

Let&apos;s also give it a background color of, let&apos;s say, light blue and
let&apos;s also give it a display of none. 
Before that, let&apos;s see the output first. 
We should get a square here, lightbox. 
Now what we want to do is initially we want it to be hidden. 
We can say display of none. 
Now if I click on Save, you will see that it is hidden for now. 
After this style tag, let&apos;s also use a script tag and we will include
the jQuery CDN, that is content delivery network. 
You can search it on Google. 

Let me just type it here. 
It is https://code.jquery.com and then we can say slash 
jQuery and then you can put the version. 
I will use 3.6.0. 
You can use any version here and the name would be.min.js. That&apos;s it. 
Let&apos;s test this out if it is working or not. 

We can have a script tag just below here. 

Now in this script tag, let&apos;s start creating an effect. 

First of all, we will say document.ready, and then we can have a
function inside it. 

Let&apos;s create a function. Here, we will add our toggle functionality. 
You can say toggle the visibility of the element with a fade in and fade
out effect on the button click. Which button? This button. 
We can see dollar and I want to target my button like this using the
selector and then we can add even listener that is click an onclick. 

I just want to run a function again. 
Here we can target our div of id myBox. 
We have to pass here hash and name of the id that is my box and then we
can use an effect that is fadeToggle and that&apos;s it. 

Let&apos;s test this out. 
If I click on Save, if I go here, we have toggle and boxes coming and
then boxes going on the other clip. 

This is a fadeToggle example that we have created. 
Make sure that you include necessarily jQuery library along with the
script tag. 
Inside the script tag, this code is wrapped in document.ready
function, ensuring that jQuery code executes when the document, in this
case, HTML page, has finished loading. 

Within this document.ready function, we haven&apos;t event handler that
is attached with a button using this.click. 
This means that when the button is clicked, the function provided as the
argument will be executed. 

Now inside the click event handler, the fadeToggle method is used. 
This method toggles the visibility of the element with the ID myBox by
feeding it in if it&apos;s hidden or feeding it out if it&apos;s visible. 

So jQuery effects allows you to add visual transitions and animations to
HTML elements. 

Effects can be used to show or hide elements, change dimensions, feed
elements in or out, and much more. 

jQuery provides a range of built-in methods for applying effects, such
as show, hide, toggle, fade-in, fade-out, fadeToggle, slide up, slide
down, slide toggle and animated. 

Effects can enhance the user experience and make webpages more engaging
and provide smooth transitions between different states of elements. 

By utilizing jQuery effects, you can easily add interactivity and visual
appeal to your web applications without writing complex animations from
scratch. 

In summary, jQuery effects are for a simple and a powerful way to
add dynamic and interactive elements. We have webpages. 

They provide an extensive set of methods that can be used to create
eye-catching transitions and animations with ease. 

This is all for this lesson. 
In the next lesson, we will learn about jQuery diversing. 
See you in the next lesson. Thank you.

<h3 id="ch3-9">3.9 jQuery Traversing (5:33)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi there. In the previous lesson, we learned about jQuery effects. 
Now in this lesson we will understand about jQuery traversing. Let&apos;s get
started. 
JQuery provides powerful methods for traversing the DOM, that is
document object model, allowing you to select and manipulate specific
elements based on their relationship to other elements. 

Traversing methods in jQuery help you navigate through the DOM tree and
select elements that match certain criteria. 
Let&apos;s understand this using an example. 
Let&apos;s go to the VS Code. 
Here I have a index.html file ready with a script tag that has a CDN of
jQuery attached. 

In this script tag, we can start writing our jQuery code. 
Before that, let&apos;s create a basic UI. 
Here, let&apos;s have our unordered list, and let&apos;s have multiple list
items. 

Let&apos;s say Item 1, and then we can say Item 2, and then let&apos;s have Item
3 as well. 

All of them would be listed here. 

Now let&apos;s start writing our jQuery code. 
First I will say dollar and document, and then I would say.ready. 
When the document is ready, I just want to run this function. 
Inside this function, we want to filter the list items and select the
ones containing two. 

We can say, var filteredItems, let&apos;s create a variable here, and we
would target LI items based on this selector. 
Then you can say.filter. 
Now, this is the traversing method, and here we can call a function. 
This function, we&apos;ll just return. 

Let&apos;s say this.text,.includes, and it should include this two here. 
Then what we can do is then we can apply a CSS class to the filtered
list item. 
What we can do here is we can see filteredItems.addClass, and we can
say, highlight, at this point. 

Let&apos;s also create a highlight part here in the style tag, and we can
say.highlight, let&apos;s just give it a background color of light blue or
let&apos;s say blue. 
If I click on &quot;Save,&quot; if I go here, you can see that this particular
element that includes two is being given the background color of blue. 

This filter method is applied to this list items to filter and select
only the list items that meet a specific criteria. 
Inside this filter method, we are providing a filtering function, as you
can see here, that returns true or false for each list item. 

In this case, the function checks if the text of each list item includes
the string 2, using the includes method. 

If it does, the function returns true, indicating that the list
item should be included in the filtered set. 

The filter list items are then stored in filter items variable here. 

Then we can perform any operations on the filtered elements. 

In this example, we apply a CSS class named highlight to the filter list
items using the add class method. 
The highlight class adds a blue background color to the list item
through the defined CSS. 

Let&apos;s summarize this. 
JQuery traversing methods provide a convenient way to select and
navigate through elements in the document object model. 

Traversing allows you to target specific elements based on their
relationships to other elements or their properties, making it easier to
manipulate or interact with them. 

There are many traversing methods like parent, children, siblings, and
filter that we have used, now that allows you to select elements based
on their position in the DOM or specific criteria. 

The parent method selects 
a direct parent element of the master element, while children selects
the direct children elements. 
These methods help you navigate up or down the DOM tree. 

The siblings method selects all sibling elements of the matched
element. 
This allows you to target the elements that share the same parent. 
The filter method lets you select a subset of elements from a larger set
based on a specific criteria. 

In our case, it was the text that has 2 in it. 
You can use filtering functions to evaluate elements based on their
properties, attributes or contents. 
JQuery traversing methods provides flexibility and power when working
with complex DOM structures, allowing you to precisely target and
manipulate elements as needed. 

By utilizing these traversing methods, you can easily navigate through
the DOM and select the desired elements for further manipulation. 
Traversing helps you write concise and efficient jQuery code, making it
an essential skill for working with complex web applications.

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
In this lesson we will talk about how to create the project structure
and how to get started in creating a Todo app. 
Let&apos;s get started. 
Let&apos;s look at the problem statement first. 
You are tasked with developing a ToDo application. 

The app should allow users to add and delete tasks. 
It should provide a user-friendly interface for adding tasks, displaying
the them in a list and allowing users to delete the task. 
The app should handle user input and create task items dynamically
and update the list accordingly. 

Key points here are that the main functionality that we have to
add is add and delete task and the list should be added dynamically. 
Let&apos;s look at the step-by-step approach of solving this problem
statement. 
First is HTML structure. 
We need to create the HTML structure for the ToDo app including a
form to add new task and a container to display the tasks. 

Then we can add necessary HTML elements such as input fields, buttons, 
containers with appropriate classes or IDs for styling and
manipulation. 
Next we can start with JavaScript functionality. 
You can write JavaScript functions to handle the core functionality 
of the ToDo app can create a function to capture user input from the
form and add new task to the task list. 

Then you can implement a function to delete task when the user interacts
with the corresponding buttons. 
You need to ensure that the app updates the task list dynamically when a
task is added or deleted. 
That is one of the core points in the problem statement. 

Then we can add some event listeners. 
You can attach event listeners to the appropriate HTML elements, for
example form submission or button clicks to trigger the corresponding
JavaScript functions. 

Need to ensure that the app responds to user interaction and updates the
UI accordingly. 
With the problem statement and step by step approach, let&apos;s start
building our ToDo application. 

Let&apos;s move to the Vs code and here let&apos;s create three files. 
I have index HTML file, a script JS file and 

let&apos;s also create a style CSS dot file. 
Now first let&apos;s start with the structure. 
What we can do is, we can just create a basic HTML template here and
let&apos;s give the title as todo app and then we can use a link tag to link
our external style sheet. 

We can say relation of style sheet and let&apos;s say type of text CSS
and an href of style.CSS.

Next in the body tag we can have an h1 for now let&apos;s say todo app and
here we can have a script tag.

Let&apos;s give it a defer attribute so it will load asynchronously
and let&apos;s also use source and pass the path that is script.JS. 
If I click on save now we should see todo app here. 

Now let&apos;s first create the structure. 
Here we want a div and let&apos;s give this a class of container.

Let&apos;s have a h1 or heading of todo app And then let&apos;s have a form. 
Let&apos;s give this an ID of task form.
And in this form we want an input where user will type the task and we
can give it a type of text and ID of let&apos;s say task input.

We can also give it a placeholder, let&apos;s say add a new task and then we
can have a button of type submit and then we can say here just a text of
add task. 

If I click on save you will see this as the output. 
We have a basic to do heading input and a button and once the user
clicks on the button we should be able to show a list. 
For that after the form we can have an ordered list and let&apos;s give
it an ID of task list like this and it should be ul.

Through this we have completed the first approach that is creating
our HTML structure. 
And this would be empty because the list would be generated dynamically,
right, the task would be generated dynamically whenever user types in
the input. 

In the next lesson we will try to add functionality and before that we
will add some styles to it.

Hi there, in the previous lesson we created the HTML structure of our
Todo app. 
Now in this lesson we will add styles to it and also some functionality
to the app. 

Let&apos;s move back to the VS code and this was our HTML structure. 
Let&apos;s open this side by side and style it. 
First that I want to style is this class container. 

Let let&apos;s give here a max width of, let&apos;s say 400 pixels and then
we can say margin of 20 pixels and auto from left and right. 
And then let&apos;s give it a background color of #fff. 
Then let&apos;s give a padding of 20 pixels from all sites. 

And let&apos;s also give it a box shadow of 0px, 2px and 5px. 
And the color that we want would be rgba and let&apos;s give it a black
shade. 
We can say 0,0,0 and the opacity would be 0.1. 

If I click on save you can see that we have a light box shadow here.
Now let&apos;s target our h1, so we can say h1 and we just want to align it
to center.
It aligns to the center now. 
And then we can target our form. 

And to this form we can just give it a margin bottom of let&apos;s say 10px.
And then we can target the input of type text like this.
And in this case, we just want to give it a width of, let&apos;s say 70%.

And let&apos;s give it a padding from all sides of 5px and let&apos;s give it a
font size of 16px as well. 
If I click on Save we have this as the output. 
Now let&apos;s target this button. 

We can say button and let&apos;s give it a padding of let&apos;s say from top
and bottom 5px, and from left and right 10px. 
Let&apos;s give it a background color of a green shade. 
That would be 4caf 50 and then let&apos;s give it a color of fff. 

And then let&apos;s give it a border of none and let&apos;s also give it a
cursor to be pointer. 
If I click on Save, this is our button and it looks cooler.
Next we can target our unordered list as well since there is nothing
here, we can just say list, style, type of none and a padding of 0. 

Since there is nothing here, we will not be able to see any output at
this point, but it will be visible as soon as we start dynamically add
using JavaScript. 
The styling part is complete. 
Now let&apos;s go to the script tag and let&apos;s create the functionality. 

In the script tag first I want to target the st elements, or we can
say get the html elements.
We only want the elements that we want to work with. 

Let&apos;s say if we want to get the form, we can say const taskForm and
we have a method for it. 
We can say document get elementbyid and we can say get the id of
taskForm like this.
And then we can say const taskInput.

To this input we can say document.get element by id and the id is
taskInput.
Let&apos;s also check if we have given the ids or not. 

To the input we have given id of taskInput and taskForm, so this is
correct. 
Otherwise you can do console and check if you are getting the element in
the variable and then in the UI you can say UL, we have given it an id
of task list. 

We can say const taskList to be document.getelementByid and we can
say taskList here. 

We have targeted all the elements. 
Now we will create a task counter.
Let&apos;s say let task id to be 1 and now we can write a logic or a
function to add a new task.
Let&apos;s create this function. 
We can say function addTask and we will get an event here because
this will be passed as a callback to the event listener. 

And then we can say event prevent default.
This will prevent the page from refreshing. 
Now, side by side, let&apos;s also add the event listener. 
We can say here add event listener to the form. 
What we can do here is we can say taskForm.addEventListener and 
we want to add a type of event that is submit. 
And then we can say the function that we have to run is addTask. 
This is the task. 

What happens is if I do not use this particular line, if I comment it
out, you would see that if I click on Add Task the page is reloading,
right? 

Although it is fast, you can see here it is reloading. 
We don&apos;t want to remove the data because the data will be lost when
you refresh the page. 
In this case we can say e prevent default or even prevent default. 
Now you can see the page has stopped refreshing.

Now we can write our logic here.
We can target the text from the input first. 
We can say const taskText and this would be coming from
taskInput.value and we can trim for any spaces.
Next we can say if this is one of the edge cases, we can say if taskText
is not equal to empty string, only then we want to move further, right? 
Because we do not want to add an empty value. 

In that case we can do what, we can create a taskItem and that is
nothing but ally item, right? 
We can say document.createElement and the element that we want to
create is li.

Next we want to add a text and some button to it so we can say
taskItem.innerhtml and we can use backticks to add a span. 

Let&apos;s add a span tag and inside this span tag we will add the
text whatever the user has typed in the input and that is taskText. 
And then we can close our span tag and then we can also add a button for
delete. 

We can say button of class. 
Let&apos;s give it a class of delete-button and then we can say delete here
as a text and let&apos;s close this button tag.
After creating a new li element, what we can do is we can say taskList
and this is our UI and we want to append taskItem to it.
And then we can say taskInput.value to be an empty string. 

This is because once we add it to the list right, we do not want to show
that value to the user on the input. 

We are removing it and then we can do something like taskId ++, so it
will increment the taskId. 
And then what we can do is we can add an event to the delete button.
How? We can say const deleteButton or we can say Btn to be taskItem
querySelector and we can select the element with the class of delete
button. 

We can say .delete-btn and then we can say delete
button.addEventListener and we can add a type of click. 
And let&apos;s also run a new function that is deleteTask.
Now let&apos;s create a function called deleteTask and that&apos;s it. 

We have written the code for add task function and we have added the
event as well.

This is all for this lesson, in the next lesson we will test this function
out and you will complete our application and then we can also discuss
about how you can enhance this application.

<h3 id="ch3-12">3.12 Project Building, Part 3 (6:03)</h3>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Hi there, in the previous lessons we have created the HTML structure
and added the functionality for add a task. 

Now in this lesson we will complete the app and make it working. 

Let&apos;s go to the VS code and here we already created the function add
task. 

Let&apos;s test this out. 
If I click on save, let&apos;s go here and add a new task. 
Let&apos;s say music. 
And as soon as I click on add, you can see that nothing is working, it
is not getting added. 
And we are getting an error here. 
That means cannot read properties of null, and we have trim here. 

Okay, this is not area value, this is just value. 
Now if I click on save, let&apos;s put music and add. 
And you can see it gets added here along with the delete button. 
And if you want to check it you can say the text gets removed inside the
input. 
If I add, let&apos;s say, study and click on add task, you can see it
also gets deleted from the input. 

Now we want to make this delete functionality working. 
We have already created or attached an event listener here
and created a delete task function. 
We will again get an event from here, event object. 

And we can say alert, clicked, just to check if the event is working
or not on the click of the delete button. 
If I go here, let&apos;s add a and b. 
If I click on delete, you can see that it is clicked and it is clicked
as well. 
It is working fine. 
Now what we can do is we can define or write a logic here to delete the
task. 

We can say const taskItem, and we can say event.target.
First of all, let&apos;s console this as well. 
So let&apos;s see what do we get in the task item.
So if I click on save, let&apos;s add a and b again. 
If I want to click on delete, you can see that we get button of delete
button class here. 
Now we don&apos;t want to delete only the button, right? 
We want to delete the whole task. 

In that case, we want to get its parent element. 
When I say parent element, e.target.parentElement, and if I click on
save, let&apos;s say a, add it again, and let&apos;s click on delete. 
You can see that now the whole li element gets targeted here. 
And now we want to remove it from the unordered list. 
What we can do here is we can just say, taskList, that is the
unordered list,dotremovechild, and we can remove this task item.

And if I click on save, you would see that if I do add a and b, and if I
want to delete a, it gets deleted and only b is left. 
We have created the Working ToDo app, and we have added the
functionalities like Add and Delete, based on the problem statement. 

Let&apos;s also discuss how you can enhance your application. 
You can add functionality like to do task completion. 
You can allow users to mark tasks as completed by adding a checkbox
or toggle button next to each task, right? 

For example, you can go here and you can add a checkbox for each task. 
And when a task is marked as completed, you can apply a different style
to indicate its completion. 
Next you can add is task editing. 
You can implement the ability for users to edit task names, and this
can be done by allowing users to click on the task text and edit it
directly. 

You can add an event listener to the task text and enable editing mode
when clicked. 
You can also provide a save button or press Enter to save the changes of
the edited task. 
You can also add a task count so you can display the total number of
tasks as the top of the app. 
You can update the count dynamically as tasks are added or deleted. 

You can also add a functionality like task filtering, you can add
options to filter tasks based on their status, completed or pending. 
And you can implement a drop down or radio buttons to allow users to
switch between different filtering options. 

You can update the task list to show only the task that match the
selected filter. 
You can also add local storage persistence so you can implement
local storage functionality to persist the task across page reloads. 
You can save the task array to local storage whenever a task is
added, deleted, or modified. 

Then you can retrieve the task from local storage when the app is loaded
to populate the task list. 
You can also implement Clear All task functionality. 
You can add a button to clear all tasks at once. 
When clicked, you can prompt the user for confirmation before deleting
all tasks from the list. 

Last but not the least, you can also add responsive design. 
That means you can make the app responsive so that it adapts well to
different screen sizes and devices. 
You can ensure that the app layout and styling remain consistent
and user friendly on both desktop and mobile devices. 

Thank you. 

The end...
